    <p>Since Wittgenstein's Tractatus is written in a numerical hierarchy, it has often been the subject of simple hypertext projects like our own. We were surprised that our design values differed significantly from these projects. We were equally delighted to see how other designers approached those goals.</p><p>David and I decided to focus our design on <b>comparison</b> and <b>flow</b>, to match Wittgenstein's stated intentions. In a footnote, he explains that the hierarchy is intended to emphasize <b>relative importance</b> and <b>sequence</b>. Furthermore, the text's <b>didactic</b> style needs explicit structure if it is to be anything greater than a collection of aphorisms. An interface which permits comparison and flow provides that structure.</p><div class="sidenote">In our early design experiments, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/4958395634/"  >we used color to denote relative importance</a>. In another, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/4962886243/"  >we used a treemap to display the entire structure</a> (and some of the text) at once.<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/4958395634/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4958395634_74fb76233d_t.jpg"/></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/4962886243/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4088/4962886243_c725093ca4_t.jpg"/></a></div></div><p>More information about our designs is available on The Hacktatus main page.</p><p>Our focus on comparison and flow seemed the opposite of other designers, who go to great lengths to <b>hide</b> <b>context</b> and <b>break up</b> <b>the text</b>, presenting individual notes without context, or hiding large parts of the text.</p><p>Most of these editions permit users to</p><ul><li> Click to see the immediate child</li><li> Click to see the immediate parent</li><li> Read some next/previous statements of a similar importance</li></ul><p>Few of them permit the tracing of a term or concept through the text. Only <a href="#bazzocchi"  >Bazzocchi's design</a> shows where in the document a reader is. And short of opening up two web browser windows, none of them the permit comparison of sections.</p><div class="sidenote">(We only realized much later that the design features of these digital editions closely resembled the objectives of our anti-design exercise:<i> <a href="natematias.com/projects/tractatus/oblique"  >The Oblique Tractatus</i></a>.)</div><p>Nonetheless, all of these designs work well on a large variety of web browsers. <a href="#laventhol"  >Laventhol's design</a> has survived on the web for nearly 15 years.</p><p>All of these hypertext versions of Tractatus apply very creative approaches to the same text:</p><ul><li> <a name ="vanderdoes" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/4974041141/in/set-72157624917575658/" style="float:right;display:inline-block;"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4146/4974041141_d3374b24af_m.jpg" border="1"/></a> <a href="http://www.vddoes.net/vanderdoes/Welcome.html"  ><b>Jaap van der Does</b></a> uses a javascript toolbar and search to help readers navigate <a href="http://tlp.vddoes.net/"  >his plain text version of the Tractatus</a>.</li><li> <a name ="satohsin" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/4974655872/in/set-72157624917575658/lightbox/" style="float:right;display:inline-block;"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4150/4974655872_ee5aaf7ba6_m.jpg" border="1"/></a>  <b>Satoh Sin</b> has made <a href="http://tractatus-online.appspot.com/Tractatus_en.html"  >an English-Japanese edition which employs stretchtext.</a> This design is innovative for its use of horizontal and vertical rules to indicate the expansion level. </li><li> <a name ="bazzocchi" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natematias/4974655982/in/set-72157624917575658/" style="float:right;display:inline-block;"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4150/4974655982_935f3b14b8_m.jpg" border="1"/></a> <b>Luciano Bazzocchi</b>, who was a PhD student at the University of Pisa, has posted a <a href="http://www.bazzocchi.com/wittgenstein/"  >linked web version of the Tractatus</a> on his website.

Like us, Laventhol added empty notes into the Tractatus to present a consistent structure. Laventhol is the edition which has been around the longest, is the most convention, bug free, and therefore is the most linked on scholarly websites.
