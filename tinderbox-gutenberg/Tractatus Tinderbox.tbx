<text >1. The world is all that is the case.1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by their being all thefacts.1.12 For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and alsowhatever is not the case.1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.1.2 The world divides into facts.1.21 Each item can be the case or not the case while everything elseremains the same.2. What is the case--a fact--is the existence of states of affairs.2.01 A state of affairs (a state of things) is a combination of objects(things).2.011 It is essential to things that they should be possibleconstituents of states of affairs.2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in a stateof affairs, the possibility of the state of affairs must be written intothe thing itself.2.0121 It would seem to be a sort of accident, if it turned out thata situation would fit a thing that could already exist entirely on itsown. If things can occur in states of affairs, this possibility mustbe in them from the beginning. (Nothing in the province of logic canbe merely possible. Logic deals with every possibility and allpossibilities are its facts.) Just as we are quite unable to imaginespatial objects outside space or temporal objects outside time, so toothere is no object that we can imagine excluded from the possibility ofcombining with others. If I can imagine objects combined in states ofaffairs, I cannot imagine them excluded from the possibility of suchcombinations.2.0122 Things are independent in so far as they can occur in allpossible situations, but this form of independence is a form ofconnexion with states of affairs, a form of dependence. (It isimpossible for words to appear in two different roles: by themselves,and in propositions.)2.0123 If I know an object I also know all its possible occurrences instates of affairs. (Every one of these possibilities must be part of thenature of the object.) A new possibility cannot be discovered later.2.01231 If I am to know an object, though I need not know its externalproperties, I must know all its internal properties.2.0124 If all objects are given, then at the same time all possiblestates of affairs are also given.2.013 Each thing is, as it were, in a space of possible states ofaffairs. This space I can imagine empty, but I cannot imagine the thingwithout the space.2.0131 A spatial object must be situated in infinite space. (A spatialpoint is an argument-place.) A speck in the visual field, thought itneed not be red, must have some colour: it is, so to speak, surroundedby colour-space. Notes must have some pitch, objects of the sense oftouch some degree of hardness, and so on.2.014 Objects contain the possibility of all situations.2.0141 The possibility of its occurring in states of affairs is the formof an object.2.02 Objects are simple.2.0201 Every statement about complexes can be resolved into a statementabout their constituents and into the propositions that describe thecomplexes completely.2.021 Objects make up the substance of the world. That is why theycannot be composite.2.0211 If the world had no substance, then whether a proposition hadsense would depend on whether another proposition was true.2.0212 In that case we could not sketch any picture of the world (trueor false).2.022 It is obvious that an imagined world, however different it may befrom the real one, must have something--a form--in common with it.2.023 Objects are just what constitute this unalterable form.2.0231 The substance of the world can only determine a form, and notany material properties. For it is only by means of propositions thatmaterial properties are represented--only by the configuration ofobjects that they are produced.2.0232 In a manner of speaking, objects are colourless.2.0233 If two objects have the same logical form, the only distinctionbetween them, apart from their external properties, is that they aredifferent.2.02331 Either a thing has properties that nothing else has, in whichcase we can immediately use a description to distinguish it from theothers and refer to it; or, on the other hand, there are several thingsthat have the whole set of their properties in common, in which case itis quite impossible to indicate one of them. For if there is nothing todistinguish a thing, I cannot distinguish it, since otherwise it wouldbe distinguished after all.2.024 The substance is what subsists independently of what is the case.2.025 It is form and content.2.0251 Space, time, colour (being coloured) are forms of objects.2.026 There must be objects, if the world is to have unalterable form.2.027 Objects, the unalterable, and the subsistent are one and the same.2.0271 Objects are what is unalterable and subsistent; theirconfiguration is what is changing and unstable.2.0272 The configuration of objects produces states of affairs.2.03 In a state of affairs objects fit into one another like the linksof a chain.2.031 In a state of affairs objects stand in a determinate relation toone another.2.032 The determinate way in which objects are connected in a state ofaffairs is the structure of the state of affairs.2.033 Form is the possibility of structure.2.034 The structure of a fact consists of the structures of states ofaffairs.2.04 The totality of existing states of affairs is the world.2.05 The totality of existing states of affairs also determines whichstates of affairs do not exist.2.06 The existence and non-existence of states of affairs is reality.(We call the existence of states of affairs a positive fact, and theirnon-existence a negative fact.)2.061 States of affairs are independent of one another.2.062 From the existence or non-existence of one state of affairs it isimpossible to infer the existence or non-existence of another.2.063 The sum-total of reality is the world.2.1 We picture facts to ourselves.2.11 A picture presents a situation in logical space, the existence andnon-existence of states of affairs.2.12 A picture is a model of reality.2.13 In a picture objects have the elements of the picture correspondingto them.2.131 In a picture the elements of the picture are the representativesof objects.2.14 What constitutes a picture is that its elements are related to oneanother in a determinate way.2.141 A picture is a fact.2.15 The fact that the elements of a picture are related to one anotherin a determinate way represents that things are related to one anotherin the same way. Let us call this connexion of its elements thestructure of the picture, and let us call the possibility of thisstructure the pictorial form of the picture.2.151 Pictorial form is the possibility that things are related to oneanother in the same way as the elements of the picture.2.1511 That is how a picture is attached to reality; it reaches rightout to it.2.1512 It is laid against reality like a measure.2.15121 Only the end-points of the graduating lines actually touch theobject that is to be measured.2.1514 So a picture, conceived in this way, also includes the pictorialrelationship, which makes it into a picture.2.1515 These correlations are, as it were, the feelers of the picture&apos;selements, with which the picture touches reality.2.16 If a fact is to be a picture, it must have something in common withwhat it depicts.2.161 There must be something identical in a picture and what itdepicts, to enable the one to be a picture of the other at all.2.17 What a picture must have in common with reality, in order to beable to depict it--correctly or incorrectly--in the way that it does, isits pictorial form.2.171 A picture can depict any reality whose form it has. A spatialpicture can depict anything spatial, a coloured one anything coloured,etc.2.172 A picture cannot, however, depict its pictorial form: it displaysit.2.173 A picture represents its subject from a position outside it.(Its standpoint is its representational form.) That is why a picturerepresents its subject correctly or incorrectly.2.174 A picture cannot, however, place itself outside itsrepresentational form.2.18 What any picture, of whatever form, must have in common withreality, in order to be able to depict it--correctly or incorrectly--inany way at all, is logical form, i.e. the form of reality.2.181 A picture whose pictorial form is logical form is called a logicalpicture.2.182 Every picture is at the same time a logical one. (On the otherhand, not every picture is, for example, a spatial one.)2.19 Logical pictures can depict the world.2.2 A picture has logico-pictorial form in common with what it depicts.2.201 A picture depicts reality by representing a possibility ofexistence and non-existence of states of affairs.2.202 A picture contains the possibility of the situation that itrepresents.2.203 A picture agrees with reality or fails to agree; it is correct orincorrect, true or false.2.22 What a picture represents it represents independently of its truthor falsity, by means of its pictorial form.2.221 What a picture represents is its sense.2.222 The agreement or disagreement or its sense with realityconstitutes its truth or falsity.2.223 In order to tell whether a picture is true or false we mustcompare it with reality.2.224 It is impossible to tell from the picture alone whether it is trueor false.2.225 There are no pictures that are true a priori.3. A logical picture of facts is a thought.3.001 &apos;A state of affairs is thinkable&apos;: what this means is that we canpicture it to ourselves.3.01 The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.3.02 A thought contains the possibility of the situation of which it isthe thought. What is thinkable is possible too.3.03 Thought can never be of anything illogical, since, if it were, weshould have to think illogically.3.031 It used to be said that God could create anything except whatwould be contrary to the laws of logic. The truth is that we could notsay what an &apos;illogical&apos; world would look like.3.032 It is as impossible to represent in language anything that&apos;contradicts logic&apos; as it is in geometry to represent by its coordinatesa figure that contradicts the laws of space, or to give the coordinatesof a point that does not exist.3.0321 Though a state of affairs that would contravene the laws ofphysics can be represented by us spatially, one that would contravenethe laws of geometry cannot.3.04 If a thought were correct a priori, it would be a thought whosepossibility ensured its truth.3.05 A priori knowledge that a thought was true would be possible onlyif its truth were recognizable from the thought itself (without anythinga to compare it with).3.1 In a proposition a thought finds an expression that can be perceivedby the senses.3.11 We use the perceptible sign of a proposition (spoken or written,etc.) as a projection of a possible situation. The method of projectionis to think of the sense of the proposition.3.12 I call the sign with which we express a thought a propositionalsign. And a proposition is a propositional sign in its projectiverelation to the world.3.13 A proposition, therefore, does not actually contain its sense,but does contain the possibility of expressing it. (&apos;The content ofa proposition&apos; means the content of a proposition that has sense.) Aproposition contains the form, but not the content, of its sense.3.14 What constitutes a propositional sign is that in its elements (thewords) stand in a determinate relation to one another. A propositionalsign is a fact.3.141 A proposition is not a blend of words.(Just as a theme in music isnot a blend of notes.) A proposition is articulate.3.142 Only facts can express a sense, a set of names cannot.3.143 Although a propositional sign is a fact, this is obscured bythe usual form of expression in writing or print. For in a printedproposition, for example, no essential difference is apparent between apropositional sign and a word. (That is what made it possible for Fregeto call a proposition a composite name.)3.1431 The essence of a propositional sign is very clearly seen if weimagine one composed of spatial objects (such as tables, chairs, andbooks) instead of written signs.3.1432 Instead of, &apos;The complex sign &quot;aRb&quot; says that a stands to b inthe relation R&apos; we ought to put, &apos;That &quot;a&quot; stands to &quot;b&quot; in a certainrelation says that aRb.&apos;3.144 Situations can be described but not given names.3.2 In a proposition a thought can be expressed in such a way thatelements of the propositional sign correspond to the objects of thethought.3.201 I call such elements &apos;simple signs&apos;, and such a proposition&apos;complete analysed&apos;.3.202 The simple signs employed in propositions are called names.3.203 A name means an object. The object is its meaning. (&apos;A&apos; is thesame sign as &apos;A&apos;.)3.21 The configuration of objects in a situation corresponds to theconfiguration of simple signs in the propositional sign.3.221 Objects can only be named. Signs are their representatives. I canonly speak about them: I cannot put them into words. Propositions canonly say how things are, not what they are.3.23 The requirement that simple signs be possible is the requirementthat sense be determinate.3.24 A proposition about a complex stands in an internal relation to aproposition about a constituent of the complex. A complex can be givenonly by its description, which will be right or wrong. A propositionthat mentions a complex will not be nonsensical, if the complex doesnot exits, but simply false. When a propositional element signifies acomplex, this can be seen from an indeterminateness in the propositionsin which it occurs. In such cases we know that the proposition leavessomething undetermined. (In fact the notation for generality containsa prototype.) The contraction of a symbol for a complex into a simplesymbol can be expressed in a definition.3.25 A proposition cannot be dissected any further by means of adefinition: it is a primitive sign.3.261 Every sign that has a definition signifies via the signs thatserve to define it; and the definitions point the way. Two signs cannotsignify in the same manner if one is primitive and the other is definedby means of primitive signs. Names cannot be anatomized by means ofdefinitions. (Nor can any sign that has a meaning independently and onits own.)3.262 What signs fail to express, their application shows. What signsslur over, their application says clearly.3.263 The meanings of primitive signs can be explained by means ofelucidations. Elucidations are propositions that stood if the meaningsof those signs are already known.3.3 Only propositions have sense; only in the nexus of a propositiondoes a name have meaning.3.31 I call any part of a proposition that characterizes its sensean expression (or a symbol). (A proposition is itself an expression.)Everything essential to their sense that propositions can have in commonwith one another is an expression. An expression is the mark of a formand a content.3.311 An expression presupposes the forms of all the propositions inwhich it can occur. It is the common characteristic mark of a class ofpropositions.3.312 It is therefore presented by means of the general form of thepropositions that it characterizes. In fact, in this form the expressionwill be constant and everything else variable.3.313 Thus an expression is presented by means of a variable whosevalues are the propositions that contain the expression. (In thelimiting case the variable becomes a constant, the expression becomes aproposition.) I call such a variable a &apos;propositional variable&apos;.3.314 An expression has meaning only in a proposition. All variables canbe construed as propositional variables. (Even variable names.)3.315 If we turn a constituent of a proposition into a variable, thereis a class of propositions all of which are values of the resultingvariable proposition. In general, this class too will be dependent onthe meaning that our arbitrary conventions have given to parts of theoriginal proposition. But if all the signs in it that have arbitrarilydetermined meanings are turned into variables, we shall still geta class of this kind. This one, however, is not dependent on anyconvention, but solely on the nature of the pro position. It correspondsto a logical form--a logical prototype.3.316 What values a propositional variable may take is something that isstipulated. The stipulation of values is the variable.3.317 To stipulate values for a propositional variable is to givethe propositions whose common characteristic the variable is. Thestipulation is a description of those propositions. The stipulation willtherefore be concerned only with symbols, not with their meaning. Andthe only thing essential to the stipulation is that it is merely adescription of symbols and states nothing about what is signified. Howthe description of the propositions is produced is not essential.3.318 Like Frege and Russell I construe a proposition as a function ofthe expressions contained in it.3.32 A sign is what can be perceived of a symbol.3.321 So one and the same sign (written or spoken, etc.) can be commonto two different symbols--in which case they will signify in differentways.3.322 Our use of the same sign to signify two different objects cannever indicate a common characteristic of the two, if we use it with twodifferent modes of signification. For the sign, of course, is arbitrary.So we could choose two different signs instead, and then what would beleft in common on the signifying side?3.323 In everyday language it very frequently happens that the sameword has different modes of signification--and so belongs to differentsymbols--or that two words that have different modes of significationare employed in propositions in what is superficially the same way. Thusthe word &apos;is&apos; figures as the copula, as a sign for identity, and as anexpression for existence; &apos;exist&apos; figures as an intransitive verb like&apos;go&apos;, and &apos;identical&apos; as an adjective; we speak of something, but alsoof something&apos;s happening. (In the proposition, &apos;Green is green&apos;--wherethe first word is the proper name of a person and the last anadjective--these words do not merely have different meanings: they aredifferent symbols.)3.324 In this way the most fundamental confusions are easily produced(the whole of philosophy is full of them).3.325 In order to avoid such errors we must make use of a sign-languagethat excludes them by not using the same sign for different symbols andby not using in a superficially similar way signs that have differentmodes of signification: that is to say, a sign-language that is governedby logical grammar--by logical syntax. (The conceptual notation of Fregeand Russell is such a language, though, it is true, it fails to excludeall mistakes.)3.326 In order to recognize a symbol by its sign we must observe how itis used with a sense.3.327 A sign does not determine a logical form unless it is takentogether with its logico-syntactical employment.3.328 If a sign is useless, it is meaningless. That is the point ofOccam&apos;s maxim. (If everything behaves as if a sign had meaning, then itdoes have meaning.)3.33 In logical syntax the meaning of a sign should never play a role.It must be possible to establish logical syntax without mentioningthe meaning of a sign: only the description of expressions may bepresupposed.3.331 From this observation we turn to Russell&apos;s &apos;theory of types&apos;. Itcan be seen that Russell must be wrong, because he had to mention themeaning of signs when establishing the rules for them.3.332 No proposition can make a statement about itself, because apropositional sign cannot be contained in itself (that is the whole ofthe &apos;theory of types&apos;).3.333 The reason why a function cannot be its own argument is that thesign for a function already contains the prototype of its argument, andit cannot contain itself. For let us suppose that the function F(fx)could be its own argument: in that case there would be a proposition&apos;F(F(fx))&apos;, in which the outer function F and the inner function F musthave different meanings, since the inner one has the form O(f(x)) andthe outer one has the form Y(O(fx)). Only the letter &apos;F&apos; is common tothe two functions, but the letter by itself signifies nothing. Thisimmediately becomes clear if instead of &apos;F(Fu)&apos; we write &apos;(do): F(Ou).Ou = Fu&apos;. That disposes of Russell&apos;s paradox.3.334 The rules of logical syntax must go without saying, once we knowhow each individual sign signifies.3.34 A proposition possesses essential and accidental features.Accidental features are those that result from the particular way inwhich the propositional sign is produced. Essential features are thosewithout which the proposition could not express its sense.3.341 So what is essential in a proposition is what all propositionsthat can express the same sense have in common. And similarly, ingeneral, what is essential in a symbol is what all symbols that canserve the same purpose have in common.3.3411 So one could say that the real name of an object was what allsymbols that signified it had in common. Thus, one by one, all kinds ofcomposition would prove to be unessential to a name.3.342 Although there is something arbitrary in our notations, this muchis not arbitrary--that when we have determined one thing arbitrarily,something else is necessarily the case. (This derives from the essenceof notation.)3.3421 A particular mode of signifying may be unimportant but it isalways important that it is a possible mode of signifying. And that isgenerally so in philosophy: again and again the individual case turnsout to be unimportant, but the possibility of each individual casediscloses something about the essence of the world.3.343 Definitions are rules for translating from one language intoanother. Any correct sign-language must be translatable into any otherin accordance with such rules: it is this that they all have in common.3.344 What signifies in a symbol is what is common to all the symbolsthat the rules of logical syntax allow us to substitute for it.3.3441 For instance, we can express what is common to all notationsfor truth-functions in the following way: they have in common that, forexample, the notation that uses &apos;Pp&apos; (&apos;not p&apos;) and &apos;p C g&apos; (&apos;p or g&apos;)can be substituted for any of them. (This serves to characterize theway in which something general can be disclosed by the possibility of aspecific notation.)3.3442 Nor does analysis resolve the sign for a complex in an arbitraryway, so that it would have a different resolution every time that it wasincorporated in a different proposition.3.4 A proposition determines a place in logical space. The existenceof this logical place is guaranteed by the mere existence of theconstituents--by the existence of the proposition with a sense.3.41 The propositional sign with logical coordinates--that is thelogical place.3.411 In geometry and logic alike a place is a possibility: somethingcan exist in it.3.42 A proposition can determine only one place in logical space:nevertheless the whole of logical space must already be given by it.(Otherwise negation, logical sum, logical product, etc., would introducemore and more new elements in co-ordination.) (The logical scaffoldingsurrounding a picture determines logical space. The force of aproposition reaches through the whole of logical space.)3.5 A propositional sign, applied and thought out, is a thought.4. A thought is a proposition with a sense.4.001 The totality of propositions is language.4.022 Man possesses the ability to construct languages capable ofexpressing every sense, without having any idea how each word hasmeaning or what its meaning is--just as people speak without knowing howthe individual sounds are produced. Everyday language is a part of thehuman organism and is no less complicated than it. It is not humanlypossible to gather immediately from it what the logic of language is.Language disguises thought. So much so, that from the outward form ofthe clothing it is impossible to infer the form of the thought beneathit, because the outward form of the clothing is not designed to revealthe form of the body, but for entirely different purposes. The tacitconventions on which the understanding of everyday language depends areenormously complicated.4.003 Most of the propositions and questions to be found inphilosophical works are not false but nonsensical. Consequently wecannot give any answer to questions of this kind, but can only pointout that they are nonsensical. Most of the propositions and questionsof philosophers arise from our failure to understand the logic of ourlanguage. (They belong to the same class as the question whether thegood is more or less identical than the beautiful.) And it is notsurprising that the deepest problems are in fact not problems at all.4.0031 All philosophy is a &apos;critique of language&apos; (though not inMauthner&apos;s sense). It was Russell who performed the service of showingthat the apparent logical form of a proposition need not be its realone.4.01 A proposition is a picture of reality. A proposition is a model ofreality as we imagine it.4.011 At first sight a proposition--one set out on the printed page, forexample--does not seem to be a picture of the reality with which itis concerned. But neither do written notes seem at first sight to be apicture of a piece of music, nor our phonetic notation (the alphabet)to be a picture of our speech. And yet these sign-languages prove to bepictures, even in the ordinary sense, of what they represent.4.012 It is obvious that a proposition of the form &apos;aRb&apos; strikes us asa picture. In this case the sign is obviously a likeness of what issignified.4.013 And if we penetrate to the essence of this pictorial character, wesee that it is not impaired by apparent irregularities (such as theuse [sharp] of and [flat] in musical notation). For even theseirregularities depict what they are intended to express; only they do itin a different way.4.014 A gramophone record, the musical idea, the written notes, and thesound-waves, all stand to one another in the same internal relationof depicting that holds between language and the world. They are allconstructed according to a common logical pattern. (Like the two youthsin the fairy-tale, their two horses, and their lilies. They are all in acertain sense one.)4.0141 There is a general rule by means of which the musician can obtainthe symphony from the score, and which makes it possible to derive thesymphony from the groove on the gramophone record, and, using the firstrule, to derive the score again. That is what constitutes the innersimilarity between these things which seem to be constructed in suchentirely different ways. And that rule is the law of projection whichprojects the symphony into the language of musical notation. It isthe rule for translating this language into the language of gramophonerecords.4.015 The possibility of all imagery, of all our pictorial modes ofexpression, is contained in the logic of depiction.4.016 In order to understand the essential nature of a proposition, weshould consider hieroglyphic script, which depicts the facts that itdescribes. And alphabetic script developed out of it without losing whatwas essential to depiction.4.02 We can see this from the fact that we understand the sense of apropositional sign without its having been explained to us.4.021 A proposition is a picture of reality: for if I understand aproposition, I know the situation that it represents. And I understandthe proposition without having had its sense explained to me.4.022 A proposition shows its sense. A proposition shows how thingsstand if it is true. And it says that they do so stand.4.023 A proposition must restrict reality to two alternatives: yesor no. In order to do that, it must describe reality completely.A proposition is a description of a state of affairs. Just as adescription of an object describes it by giving its external properties,so a proposition describes reality by its internal properties. Aproposition constructs a world with the help of a logical scaffolding,so that one can actually see from the proposition how everythingstands logically if it is true. One can draw inferences from a falseproposition.4.024 To understand a proposition means to know what is the case if itis true. (One can understand it, therefore, without knowing whether itis true.) It is understood by anyone who understands its constituents.4.025 When translating one language into another, we do not proceed bytranslating each proposition of the one into a proposition of the other,but merely by translating the constituents of propositions. (And thedictionary translates not only substantives, but also verbs, adjectives,and conjunctions, etc.; and it treats them all in the same way.)4.026 The meanings of simple signs (words) must be explained to us ifwe are to understand them. With propositions, however, we make ourselvesunderstood.4.027 It belongs to the essence of a proposition that it should be ableto communicate a new sense to us.4.03 A proposition must use old expressions to communicate a newsense. A proposition communicates a situation to us, and so it must beessentially connected with the situation. And the connexion is preciselythat it is its logical picture. A proposition states something only inso far as it is a picture.4.031 In a proposition a situation is, as it were, constructed by way ofexperiment. Instead of, &apos;This proposition has such and such a sense, wecan simply say, &apos;This proposition represents such and such a situation&apos;.4.0311 One name stands for one thing, another for another thing, andthey are combined with one another. In this way the whole group--like atableau vivant--presents a state of affairs.4.0312 The possibility of propositions is based on the principle thatobjects have signs as their representatives. My fundamental idea is thatthe &apos;logical constants&apos; are not representatives; that there can be norepresentatives of the logic of facts.4.032 It is only in so far as a proposition is logically articulatedthat it is a picture of a situation. (Even the proposition, &apos;Ambulo&apos;,is composite: for its stem with a different ending yields a differentsense, and so does its ending with a different stem.)4.04 In a proposition there must be exactly as many distinguishableparts as in the situation that it represents. The two must possess thesame logical (mathematical) multiplicity. (Compare Hertz&apos;s Mechanics ondynamical models.)4.041 This mathematical multiplicity, of course, cannot itself be thesubject of depiction. One cannot get away from it when depicting.4.0411. If, for example, we wanted to express what we now write as &apos;(x).fx&apos; by putting an affix in front of &apos;fx&apos;--for instance by writing&apos;Gen. fx&apos;--it would not be adequate: we should not know what wasbeing generalized. If we wanted to signalize it with an affix &apos;g&apos;--forinstance by writing &apos;f(xg)&apos;--that would not be adequate either: weshould not know the scope of the generality-sign. If we were to try todo it by introducing a mark into the argument-places--for instance bywriting &apos;(G,G). F(G,G)&apos; --it would not be adequate: we should not beable to establish the identity of the variables. And so on. All thesemodes of signifying are inadequate because they lack the necessarymathematical multiplicity.4.0412 For the same reason the idealist&apos;s appeal to &apos;spatial spectacles&apos;is inadequate to explain the seeing of spatial relations, because itcannot explain the multiplicity of these relations.4.05 Reality is compared with propositions.4.06 A proposition can be true or false only in virtue of being apicture of reality.4.061 It must not be overlooked that a proposition has a sense that isindependent of the facts: otherwise one can easily suppose that true andfalse are relations of equal status between signs and what they signify.In that case one could say, for example, that &apos;p&apos; signified in the trueway what &apos;Pp&apos; signified in the false way, etc.4.062 Can we not make ourselves understood with false propositions justas we have done up till now with true ones?--So long as it is known thatthey are meant to be false.--No! For a proposition is true if we use itto say that things stand in a certain way, and they do; and if by &apos;p&apos; wemean Pp and things stand as we mean that they do, then, construed in thenew way, &apos;p&apos; is true and not false.4.0621 But it is important that the signs &apos;p&apos; and &apos;Pp&apos; can say the samething. For it shows that nothing in reality corresponds to the sign&apos;P&apos;. The occurrence of negation in a proposition is not enough tocharacterize its sense (PPp = p). The propositions &apos;p&apos; and &apos;Pp&apos; haveopposite sense, but there corresponds to them one and the same reality.4.063 An analogy to illustrate the concept of truth: imagine a blackspot on white paper: you can describe the shape of the spot by saying,for each point on the sheet, whether it is black or white. To the factthat a point is black there corresponds a positive fact, and to the factthat a point is white (not black), a negative fact. If I designatea point on the sheet (a truth-value according to Frege), then thiscorresponds to the supposition that is put forward for judgement, etc.etc. But in order to be able to say that a point is black or white, Imust first know when a point is called black, and when white: in orderto be able to say,&apos;&quot;p&quot; is true (or false)&apos;, I must have determined inwhat circumstances I call &apos;p&apos; true, and in so doing I determine thesense of the proposition. Now the point where the simile breaks down isthis: we can indicate a point on the paper even if we do not knowwhat black and white are, but if a proposition has no sense, nothingcorresponds to it, since it does not designate a thing (a truth-value)which might have properties called &apos;false&apos; or &apos;true&apos;. The verb of aproposition is not &apos;is true&apos; or &apos;is false&apos;, as Frege thought: rather,that which &apos;is true&apos; must already contain the verb.4.064 Every proposition must already have a sense: it cannot be given asense by affirmation. Indeed its sense is just what is affirmed. And thesame applies to negation, etc.4.0641 One could say that negation must be related to the logicalplace determined by the negated proposition. The negating propositiondetermines a logical place different from that of the negatedproposition. The negating proposition determines a logical placewith the help of the logical place of the negated proposition. For itdescribes it as lying outside the latter&apos;s logical place. The negatedproposition can be negated again, and this in itself shows that whatis negated is already a proposition, and not merely something that ispreliminary to a proposition.4.1 Propositions represent the existence and non-existence of states ofaffairs.4.11 The totality of true propositions is the whole of natural science(or the whole corpus of the natural sciences).4.111 Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences. (The word&apos;philosophy&apos; must mean something whose place is above or below thenatural sciences, not beside them.)4.112 Philosophy aims at the logical clarification of thoughts.Philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity. A philosophicalwork consists essentially of elucidations. Philosophy does not resultin &apos;philosophical propositions&apos;, but rather in the clarification ofpropositions. Without philosophy thoughts are, as it were, cloudyand indistinct: its task is to make them clear and to give them sharpboundaries.4.1121 Psychology is no more closely related to philosophy thanany other natural science. Theory of knowledge is the philosophy ofpsychology. Does not my study of sign-language correspond to the studyof thought-processes, which philosophers used to consider so essentialto the philosophy of logic? Only in most cases they got entangled inunessential psychological investigations, and with my method too thereis an analogous risk.4.1122 Darwin&apos;s theory has no more to do with philosophy than any otherhypothesis in natural science.4.113 Philosophy sets limits to the much disputed sphere of naturalscience.4.114 It must set limits to what can be thought; and, in doing so, towhat cannot be thought. It must set limits to what cannot be thought byworking outwards through what can be thought.4.115 It will signify what cannot be said, by presenting clearly whatcan be said.4.116 Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly.Everything that can be put into words can be put clearly.4.12 Propositions can represent the whole of reality, but they cannotrepresent what they must have in common with reality in order to be ableto represent it--logical form. In order to be able to represent logicalform, we should have to be able to station ourselves with propositionssomewhere outside logic, that is to say outside the world.4.121 Propositions cannot represent logical form: it is mirrored inthem. What finds its reflection in language, language cannot represent.What expresses itself in language, we cannot express by means oflanguage. Propositions show the logical form of reality. They displayit.4.1211 Thus one proposition &apos;fa&apos; shows that the object a occurs inits sense, two propositions &apos;fa&apos; and &apos;ga&apos; show that the same object ismentioned in both of them. If two propositions contradict one another,then their structure shows it; the same is true if one of them followsfrom the other. And so on.4.1212 What can be shown, cannot be said.4.1213 Now, too, we understand our feeling that once we have asign-language in which everything is all right, we already have acorrect logical point of view.4.122 In a certain sense we can talk about formal properties of objectsand states of affairs, or, in the case of facts, about structuralproperties: and in the same sense about formal relations and structuralrelations. (Instead of &apos;structural property&apos; I also say &apos;internalproperty&apos;; instead of &apos;structural relation&apos;, &apos;internal relation&apos;. Iintroduce these expressions in order to indicate the source of theconfusion between internal relations and relations proper (externalrelations), which is very widespread among philosophers.) It isimpossible, however, to assert by means of propositions that suchinternal properties and relations obtain: rather, this makes itselfmanifest in the propositions that represent the relevant states ofaffairs and are concerned with the relevant objects.4.1221 An internal property of a fact can also be bed a feature of thatfact (in the sense in which we speak of facial features, for example).4.123 A property is internal if it is unthinkable that its object shouldnot possess it. (This shade of blue and that one stand, eo ipso, in theinternal relation of lighter to darker. It is unthinkable that these twoobjects should not stand in this relation.) (Here the shifting useof the word &apos;object&apos; corresponds to the shifting use of the words&apos;property&apos; and &apos;relation&apos;.)4.124 The existence of an internal property of a possible situation isnot expressed by means of a proposition: rather, it expresses itselfin the proposition representing the situation, by means of an internalproperty of that proposition. It would be just as nonsensical to assertthat a proposition had a formal property as to deny it.4.1241 It is impossible to distinguish forms from one another bysaying that one has this property and another that property: for thispresupposes that it makes sense to ascribe either property to eitherform.4.125 The existence of an internal relation between possible situationsexpresses itself in language by means of an internal relation betweenthe propositions representing them.4.1251 Here we have the answer to the vexed question &apos;whether allrelations are internal or external&apos;.4.1252 I call a series that is ordered by an internal relation a seriesof forms. The order of the number-series is not governed by an externalrelation but by an internal relation. The same is true of the series ofpropositions &apos;aRb&apos;, &apos;(d: c): aRx. xRb&apos;, &apos;(d x,y): aRx. xRy. yRb&apos;, and soforth. (If b stands in one of these relations to a, I call b a successorof a.)4.126 We can now talk about formal concepts, in the same sense that wespeak of formal properties. (I introduce this expression in order toexhibit the source of the confusion between formal concepts and conceptsproper, which pervades the whole of traditional logic.) When somethingfalls under a formal concept as one of its objects, this cannot beexpressed by means of a proposition. Instead it is shown in the verysign for this object. (A name shows that it signifies an object, a signfor a number that it signifies a number, etc.) Formal concepts cannot,in fact, be represented by means of a function, as concepts proper can.For their characteristics, formal properties, are not expressed bymeans of functions. The expression for a formal property is a feature ofcertain symbols. So the sign for the characteristics of a formal conceptis a distinctive feature of all symbols whose meanings fall under theconcept. So the expression for a formal concept is a propositionalvariable in which this distinctive feature alone is constant.4.127 The propositional variable signifies the formal concept, and itsvalues signify the objects that fall under the concept.4.1271 Every variable is the sign for a formal concept. For everyvariable represents a constant form that all its values possess, andthis can be regarded as a formal property of those values.4.1272 Thus the variable name &apos;x&apos; is the proper sign for thepseudo-concept object. Wherever the word &apos;object&apos; (&apos;thing&apos;, etc.) iscorrectly used, it is expressed in conceptual notation by a variablename. For example, in the proposition, &apos;There are 2 objects which.. .&apos;,it is expressed by &apos; (dx,y)... &apos;. Wherever it is used in a differentway, that is as a proper concept-word, nonsensical pseudo-propositionsare the result. So one cannot say, for example, &apos;There are objects&apos;, asone might say, &apos;There are books&apos;. And it is just as impossible tosay, &apos;There are 100 objects&apos;, or, &apos;There are!0 objects&apos;. And it isnonsensical to speak of the total number of objects. The same applies tothe words &apos;complex&apos;, &apos;fact&apos;, &apos;function&apos;, &apos;number&apos;, etc. They allsignify formal concepts, and are represented in conceptual notation byvariables, not by functions or classes (as Frege and Russell believed).&apos;1 is a number&apos;, &apos;There is only one zero&apos;, and all similar expressionsare nonsensical. (It is just as nonsensical to say, &apos;There is only one1&apos;, as it would be to say, &apos;2 + 2 at 3 o&apos;clock equals 4&apos;.)4.12721 A formal concept is given immediately any object falling underit is given. It is not possible, therefore, to introduce as primitiveideas objects belonging to a formal concept and the formal conceptitself. So it is impossible, for example, to introduce as primitiveideas both the concept of a function and specific functions, as Russelldoes; or the concept of a number and particular numbers.4.1273 If we want to express in conceptual notation the generalproposition, &apos;b is a successor of a&apos;, then we require an expression forthe general term of the series of forms &apos;aRb&apos;, &apos;(d: c): aRx. xRb&apos;, &apos;(dx,y) : aRx. xRy. yRb&apos;,..., In order to express the general term of aseries of forms, we must use a variable, because the concept &apos;termof that series of forms&apos; is a formal concept. (This is what Frege andRussell overlooked: consequently the way in which they want to expressgeneral propositions like the one above is incorrect; it contains avicious circle.) We can determine the general term of a series of formsby giving its first term and the general form of the operation thatproduces the next term out of the proposition that precedes it.4.1274 To ask whether a formal concept exists is nonsensical. For noproposition can be the answer to such a question. (So, for example,the question, &apos;Are there unanalysable subject-predicate propositions?&apos;cannot be asked.)4.128 Logical forms are without number. Hence there are no pre-eminentnumbers in logic, and hence there is no possibility of philosophicalmonism or dualism, etc.4.2 The sense of a proposition is its agreement and disagreement withpossibilities of existence and non-existence of states of affairs. 4.21The simplest kind of proposition, an elementary proposition, asserts theexistence of a state of affairs.4.211 It is a sign of a proposition&apos;s being elementary that there can beno elementary proposition contradicting it.4.22 An elementary proposition consists of names. It is a nexus, aconcatenation, of names.4.221 It is obvious that the analysis of propositions must bring us toelementary propositions which consist of names in immediate combination.This raises the question how such combination into propositions comesabout.4.2211 Even if the world is infinitely complex, so that every factconsists of infinitely many states of affairs and every state of affairsis composed of infinitely many objects, there would still have to beobjects and states of affairs.4.23 It is only in the nexus of an elementary proposition that a nameoccurs in a proposition.4.24 Names are the simple symbols: I indicate them by single letters(&apos;x&apos;, &apos;y&apos;, &apos;z&apos;). I write elementary propositions as functions of names,so that they have the form &apos;fx&apos;, &apos;O (x,y)&apos;, etc. Or I indicate them bythe letters &apos;p&apos;, &apos;q&apos;, &apos;r&apos;.4.241 When I use two signs with one and the same meaning, I express thisby putting the sign &apos;=&apos; between them. So &apos;a = b&apos; means that the sign &apos;b&apos;can be substituted for the sign &apos;a&apos;. (If I use an equation to introducea new sign &apos;b&apos;, laying down that it shall serve as a substitute fora sign a that is already known, then, like Russell, I write theequation--definition--in the form &apos;a = b Def.&apos; A definition is a ruledealing with signs.)4.242 Expressions of the form &apos;a = b&apos; are, therefore, mererepresentational devices. They state nothing about the meaning of thesigns &apos;a&apos; and &apos;b&apos;.4.243 Can we understand two names without knowing whether they signifythe same thing or two different things?--Can we understand a propositionin which two names occur without knowing whether their meaning is thesame or different? Suppose I know the meaning of an English word and ofa German word that means the same: then it is impossible for me to beunaware that they do mean the same; I must be capable of translatingeach into the other. Expressions like &apos;a = a&apos;, and those derived fromthem, are neither elementary propositions nor is there any other way inwhich they have sense. (This will become evident later.)4.25 If an elementary proposition is true, the state of affairs exists:if an elementary proposition is false, the state of affairs does notexist.4.26 If all true elementary propositions are given, the result is acomplete description of the world. The world is completely described bygiving all elementary propositions, and adding which of them are trueand which false. For n states of affairs, there are possibilities ofexistence and non-existence. Of these states of affairs any combinationcan exist and the remainder not exist.4.28 There correspond to these combinations the same number ofpossibilities of truth--and falsity--for n elementary propositions.4.3 Truth-possibilities of elementary propositions mean Possibilities ofexistence and non-existence of states of affairs.4.31 We can represent truth-possibilities by schemata of the followingkind (&apos;T&apos; means &apos;true&apos;, &apos;F&apos; means &apos;false&apos;; the rows of &apos;T&apos;s&apos; and&apos;F&apos;s&apos; under the row of elementary propositions symbolize theirtruth-possibilities in a way that can easily be understood):4.4 A proposition is an expression of agreement and disagreement withtruth-possibilities of elementary propositions.4.41 Truth-possibilities of elementary propositions are the conditionsof the truth and falsity of propositions.4.411 It immediately strikes one as probable that the introduction ofelementary propositions provides the basis for understanding all otherkinds of proposition. Indeed the understanding of general propositionspalpably depends on the understanding of elementary propositions.4.42 For n elementary propositions there are ways in which a propositioncan agree and disagree with their truth possibilities.4.43 We can express agreement with truth-possibilities by correlatingthe mark &apos;T&apos; (true) with them in the schema. The absence of this markmeans disagreement.4.431 The expression of agreement and disagreement with the truthpossibilities of elementary propositions expresses the truth-conditionsof a proposition. A proposition is the expression of itstruth-conditions. (Thus Frege was quite right to use them as a startingpoint when he explained the signs of his conceptual notation. But theexplanation of the concept of truth that Frege gives is mistaken: if&apos;the true&apos; and &apos;the false&apos; were really objects, and were the argumentsin Pp etc., then Frege&apos;s method of determining the sense of &apos;Pp&apos; wouldleave it absolutely undetermined.)4.44 The sign that results from correlating the mark &apos;I&apos; withtruth-possibilities is a propositional sign.4.441 It is clear that a complex of the signs &apos;F&apos; and &apos;T&apos; has no object(or complex of objects) corresponding to it, just as there isnone corresponding to the horizontal and vertical lines or to thebrackets.--There are no &apos;logical objects&apos;. Of course the same applies toall signs that express what the schemata of &apos;T&apos;s&apos; and &apos;F&apos;s&apos; express.4.442 For example, the following is a propositional sign: (Frege&apos;s&apos;judgement stroke&apos; &apos;|-&apos; is logically quite meaningless: in the worksof Frege (and Russell) it simply indicates that these authors hold thepropositions marked with this sign to be true. Thus &apos;|-&apos; is no more acomponent part of a proposition than is, for instance, the proposition&apos;snumber. It is quite impossible for a proposition to state that it itselfis true.) If the order or the truth-possibilities in a scheme is fixedonce and for all by a combinatory rule, then the last column by itselfwill be an expression of the truth-conditions. If we now write thiscolumn as a row, the propositional sign will become &apos;(TT-T) (p,q)&apos; ormore explicitly &apos;(TTFT) (p,q)&apos; (The number of places in the left-handpair of brackets is determined by the number of terms in the right-handpair.)4.45 For n elementary propositions there are Ln possible groups oftruth-conditions. The groups of truth-conditions that are obtainablefrom the truth-possibilities of a given number of elementarypropositions can be arranged in a series.4.46 Among the possible groups of truth-conditions there are twoextreme cases. In one of these cases the proposition is true for allthe truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions. We say that thetruth-conditions are tautological. In the second case the propositionis false for all the truth-possibilities: the truth-conditions arecontradictory. In the first case we call the proposition a tautology; inthe second, a contradiction.4.461 Propositions show what they say; tautologies and contradictionsshow that they say nothing. A tautology has no truth-conditions, sinceit is unconditionally true: and a contradiction is true on no condition.Tautologies and contradictions lack sense. (Like a point from which twoarrows go out in opposite directions to one another.) (For example, Iknow nothing about the weather when I know that it is either raining ornot raining.)4.46211 Tautologies and contradictions are not, however, nonsensical.They are part of the symbolism, much as &apos;0&apos; is part of the symbolism ofarithmetic.4.462 Tautologies and contradictions are not pictures of reality. Theydo not represent any possible situations. For the former admit allpossible situations, and latter none. In a tautology the conditions ofagreement with the world--the representational relations--cancel oneanother, so that it does not stand in any representational relation toreality.4.463 The truth-conditions of a proposition determine the range that itleaves open to the facts. (A proposition, a picture, or a model is,in the negative sense, like a solid body that restricts the freedom ofmovement of others, and in the positive sense, like a space bounded bysolid substance in which there is room for a body.) A tautology leavesopen to reality the whole--the infinite whole--of logical space: acontradiction fills the whole of logical space leaving no point of itfor reality. Thus neither of them can determine reality in any way.4.464 A tautology&apos;s truth is certain, a proposition&apos;s possible, acontradiction&apos;s impossible. (Certain, possible, impossible: here wehave the first indication of the scale that we need in the theory ofprobability.)4.465 The logical product of a tautology and a proposition says the samething as the proposition. This product, therefore, is identical with theproposition. For it is impossible to alter what is essential to a symbolwithout altering its sense.4.466 What corresponds to a determinate logical combination of signs isa determinate logical combination of their meanings. It is only to theuncombined signs that absolutely any combination corresponds. Inother words, propositions that are true for every situation cannot becombinations of signs at all, since, if they were, only determinatecombinations of objects could correspond to them. (And what is not alogical combination has no combination of objects corresponding toit.) Tautology and contradiction are the limiting cases--indeed thedisintegration--of the combination of signs.4.4661 Admittedly the signs are still combined with one another even intautologies and contradictions--i.e. they stand in certain relations toone another: but these relations have no meaning, they are not essentialto the symbol.4.5 It now seems possible to give the most general propositional form:that is, to give a description of the propositions of any sign-languagewhatsoever in such a way that every possible sense can be expressed bya symbol satisfying the description, and every symbol satisfying thedescription can express a sense, provided that the meanings of the namesare suitably chosen. It is clear that only what is essential to themost general propositional form may be included in its description--forotherwise it would not be the most general form. The existence of ageneral propositional form is proved by the fact that there cannot be aproposition whose form could not have been foreseen (i.e. constructed).The general form of a proposition is: This is how things stand.4.51 Suppose that I am given all elementary propositions: then I cansimply ask what propositions I can construct out of them. And there Ihave all propositions, and that fixes their limits.4.52 Propositions comprise all that follows from the totality of allelementary propositions (and, of course, from its being the totalityof them all ). (Thus, in a certain sense, it could be said that allpropositions were generalizations of elementary propositions.)4.53 The general propositional form is a variable.5. A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions.(An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)5.01 Elementary propositions are the truth-arguments of propositions.5.02 The arguments of functions are readily confused with the affixes ofnames. For both arguments and affixes enable me to recognize the meaningof the signs containing them. For example, when Russell writes &apos;+c&apos;,the &apos;c&apos; is an affix which indicates that the sign as a whole is theaddition-sign for cardinal numbers. But the use of this sign is theresult of arbitrary convention and it would be quite possible to choosea simple sign instead of &apos;+c&apos;; in &apos;Pp&apos; however, &apos;p&apos; is not an affix butan argument: the sense of &apos;Pp&apos; cannot be understood unless the sense of&apos;p&apos; has been understood already. (In the name Julius Caesar &apos;Julius&apos;is an affix. An affix is always part of a description of the object towhose name we attach it: e.g. the Caesar of the Julian gens.) If Iam not mistaken, Frege&apos;s theory about the meaning of propositions andfunctions is based on the confusion between an argument and an affix.Frege regarded the propositions of logic as names, and their argumentsas the affixes of those names.5.1 Truth-functions can be arranged in series. That is the foundation ofthe theory of probability.5.101 The truth-functions of a given number of elementary propositionscan always be set out in a schema of the following kind: (TTTT) (p, q)Tautology (If p then p, and if q then q.) (p z p. q z q) (FTTT) (p, q)In words: Not both p and q. (P(p. q)) (TFTT) (p, q) &quot;: If q then p. (qz p) (TTFT) (p, q) &quot;: If p then q. (p z q) (TTTF) (p, q) &quot;: p or q. (p Cq) (FFTT) (p, q) &quot;: Not g. (Pq) (FTFT) (p, q) &quot;: Not p. (Pp) (FTTF) (p,q) &quot; : p or q, but not both. (p. Pq: C: q. Pp) (TFFT) (p, q) &quot;: If pthen p, and if q then p. (p + q) (TFTF) (p, q) &quot;: p (TTFF) (p, q) &quot;: q(FFFT) (p, q) &quot;: Neither p nor q. (Pp. Pq or p | q) (FFTF) (p, q) &quot;: pand not q. (p. Pq) (FTFF) (p, q) &quot;: q and not p. (q. Pp) (TFFF) (p,q) &quot;:q and p. (q. p) (FFFF) (p, q) Contradiction (p and not p, and q and notq.) (p. Pp. q. Pq) I will give the name truth-grounds of a propositionto those truth-possibilities of its truth-arguments that make it true.5.11 If all the truth-grounds that are common to a number ofpropositions are at the same time truth-grounds of a certainproposition, then we say that the truth of that proposition follows fromthe truth of the others.5.12 In particular, the truth of a proposition &apos;p&apos; follows from thetruth of another proposition &apos;q&apos; is all the truth-grounds of the latterare truth-grounds of the former.5.121 The truth-grounds of the one are contained in those of the other:p follows from q.5.122 If p follows from q, the sense of &apos;p&apos; is contained in the sense of&apos;q&apos;.5.123 If a god creates a world in which certain propositions aretrue, then by that very act he also creates a world in which all thepropositions that follow from them come true. And similarly he could notcreate a world in which the proposition &apos;p&apos; was true without creatingall its objects.5.124 A proposition affirms every proposition that follows from it.5.1241 &apos;p. q&apos; is one of the propositions that affirm &apos;p&apos; and at thesame time one of the propositions that affirm &apos;q&apos;. Two propositions areopposed to one another if there is no proposition with a sense, thataffirms them both. Every proposition that contradicts another negate it.5.13 When the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of others,we can see this from the structure of the proposition.5.131 If the truth of one proposition follows from the truth ofothers, this finds expression in relations in which the forms of thepropositions stand to one another: nor is it necessary for us to set upthese relations between them, by combining them with one another in asingle proposition; on the contrary, the relations are internal,and their existence is an immediate result of the existence of thepropositions.5.1311 When we infer q from p C q and Pp, the relation between thepropositional forms of &apos;p C q&apos; and &apos;Pp&apos; is masked, in this case, by ourmode of signifying. But if instead of &apos;p C q&apos; we write, for example,&apos;p|q. |. p|q&apos;, and instead of &apos;Pp&apos;, &apos;p|p&apos; (p|q = neither p nor q), thenthe inner connexion becomes obvious. (The possibility of inference from(x). fx to fa shows that the symbol (x). fx itself has generality init.)5.132 If p follows from q, I can make an inference from q to p, deducep from q. The nature of the inference can be gathered only from the twopropositions. They themselves are the only possible justification ofthe inference. &apos;Laws of inference&apos;, which are supposed to justifyinferences, as in the works of Frege and Russell, have no sense, andwould be superfluous.5.133 All deductions are made a priori.5.134 One elementary proposition cannot be deduced form another.5.135 There is no possible way of making an inference form the existenceof one situation to the existence of another, entirely differentsituation.5.136 There is no causal nexus to justify such an inference.5.1361 We cannot infer the events of the future from those of thepresent. Belief in the causal nexus is superstition.5.1362 The freedom of the will consists in the impossibility of knowingactions that still lie in the future. We could know them only ifcausality were an inner necessity like that of logical inference.--Theconnexion between knowledge and what is known is that of logicalnecessity. (&apos;A knows that p is the case&apos;, has no sense if p is atautology.)5.1363 If the truth of a proposition does not follow from the fact thatit is self-evident to us, then its self-evidence in no way justifies ourbelief in its truth.5.14 If one proposition follows from another, then the latter says morethan the former, and the former less than the latter.5.141 If p follows from q and q from p, then they are one and sameproposition.5.142 A tautology follows from all propositions: it says nothing.5.143 Contradiction is that common factor of propositions which noproposition has in common with another. Tautology is the common factorof all propositions that have nothing in common with one another.Contradiction, one might say, vanishes outside all propositions:tautology vanishes inside them. Contradiction is the outer limit ofpropositions: tautology is the unsubstantial point at their centre.5.15 If Tr is the number of the truth-grounds of a proposition &apos;r&apos;, andif Trs is the number of the truth-grounds of a proposition &apos;s&apos; that areat the same time truth-grounds of &apos;r&apos;, then we call the ratio Trs:Tr the degree of probability that the proposition &apos;r&apos; gives to theproposition &apos;s&apos;. 5.151 In a schema like the one above in5.101, let Tr be the number of &apos;T&apos;s&apos; in the proposition r, and let Trs,be the number of &apos;T&apos;s&apos; in the proposition s that stand in columns inwhich the proposition r has &apos;T&apos;s&apos;. Then the proposition r gives to theproposition s the probability Trs: Tr.5.1511 There is no special object peculiar to probability propositions.5.152 When propositions have no truth-arguments in common with oneanother, we call them independent of one another. Two elementarypropositions give one another the probability 1/2. If p follows from q,then the proposition &apos;q&apos; gives to the proposition &apos;p&apos; the probability1. The certainty of logical inference is a limiting case of probability.(Application of this to tautology and contradiction.)5.153 In itself, a proposition is neither probable nor improbable.Either an event occurs or it does not: there is no middle way.5.154 Suppose that an urn contains black and white balls in equalnumbers (and none of any other kind). I draw one ball after another,putting them back into the urn. By this experiment I can establish thatthe number of black balls drawn and the number of white balls drawnapproximate to one another as the draw continues. So this is not amathematical truth. Now, if I say, &apos;The probability of my drawing awhite ball is equal to the probability of my drawing a black one&apos;, thismeans that all the circumstances that I know of (including the laws ofnature assumed as hypotheses) give no more probability to the occurrenceof the one event than to that of the other. That is to say, they giveeach the probability 1/2 as can easily be gathered from the abovedefinitions. What I confirm by the experiment is that the occurrence ofthe two events is independent of the circumstances of which I have nomore detailed knowledge.5.155 The minimal unit for a probability proposition is this: Thecircumstances--of which I have no further knowledge--give such and sucha degree of probability to the occurrence of a particular event.5.156 It is in this way that probability is a generalization. Itinvolves a general description of a propositional form. We useprobability only in default of certainty--if our knowledge of a factis not indeed complete, but we do know something about its form. (Aproposition may well be an incomplete picture of a certain situation,but it is always a complete picture of something.) A probabilityproposition is a sort of excerpt from other propositions.5.2 The structures of propositions stand in internal relations to oneanother.5.21 In order to give prominence to these internal relations we canadopt the following mode of expression: we can represent a propositionas the result of an operation that produces it out of other propositions(which are the bases of the operation).5.22 An operation is the expression of a relation between the structuresof its result and of its bases.5.23 The operation is what has to be done to the one proposition inorder to make the other out of it.5.231 And that will, of course, depend on their formal properties, onthe internal similarity of their forms.5.232 The internal relation by which a series is ordered is equivalentto the operation that produces one term from another.5.233 Operations cannot make their appearance before the point at whichone proposition is generated out of another in a logically meaningfulway; i.e. the point at which the logical construction of propositionsbegins.5.234 Truth-functions of elementary propositions are results ofoperations with elementary propositions as bases. (These operations Icall truth-operations.)5.2341 The sense of a truth-function of p is a function of the senseof p. Negation, logical addition, logical multiplication, etc. etc. areoperations. (Negation reverses the sense of a proposition.)5.24 An operation manifests itself in a variable; it shows how we canget from one form of proposition to another. It gives expression to thedifference between the forms. (And what the bases of an operation andits result have in common is just the bases themselves.)5.241 An operation is not the mark of a form, but only of a differencebetween forms.5.242 The operation that produces &apos;q&apos; from &apos;p&apos; also produces &apos;r&apos; from&apos;q&apos;, and so on. There is only one way of expressing this: &apos;p&apos;, &apos;q&apos;,&apos;r&apos;, etc. have to be variables that give expression in a general way tocertain formal relations.5.25 The occurrence of an operation does not characterize the sense ofa proposition. Indeed, no statement is made by an operation, but only byits result, and this depends on the bases of the operation. (Operationsand functions must not be confused with each other.)5.251 A function cannot be its own argument, whereas an operation cantake one of its own results as its base.5.252 It is only in this way that the step from one term of a seriesof forms to another is possible (from one type to another in thehierarchies of Russell and Whitehead). (Russell and Whitehead did notadmit the possibility of such steps, but repeatedly availed themselvesof it.)5.2521 If an operation is applied repeatedly to its own results, I speakof successive applications of it. (&apos;O&apos;O&apos;O&apos;a&apos; is the result of threesuccessive applications of the operation &apos;O&apos;E&apos; to &apos;a&apos;.) In a similarsense I speak of successive applications of more than one operation to anumber of propositions.5.2522 Accordingly I use the sign &apos;[a, x, O&apos;x]&apos; for the general term ofthe series of forms a, O&apos;a, O&apos;O&apos;a,.... This bracketed expression is avariable: the first term of the bracketed expression is the beginningof the series of forms, the second is the form of a term x arbitrarilyselected from the series, and the third is the form of the term thatimmediately follows x in the series.5.2523 The concept of successive applications of an operation isequivalent to the concept &apos;and so on&apos;.5.253 One operation can counteract the effect of another. Operations cancancel one another.5.254 An operation can vanish (e.g. negation in &apos;PPp&apos;: PPp = p).5.3 All propositions are results of truth-operations on elementarypropositions. A truth-operation is the way in which a truth-functionis produced out of elementary propositions. It is of the essenceof truth-operations that, just as elementary propositions yield atruth-function of themselves, so too in the same way truth-functionsyield a further truth-function. When a truth-operation is applied totruth-functions of elementary propositions, it always generates anothertruth-function of elementary propositions, another proposition. Whena truth-operation is applied to the results of truth-operationson elementary propositions, there is always a single operation onelementary propositions that has the same result. Every proposition isthe result of truth-operations on elementary propositions.5.31 The schemata in 4.31 have a meaning even when &apos;p&apos;, &apos;q&apos;, &apos;r&apos;,etc. are not elementary propositions. And it is easy to see thatthe propositional sign in 4.442 expresses a single truth-function ofelementary propositions even when &apos;p&apos; and &apos;q&apos; are truth-functions ofelementary propositions.5.32 All truth-functions are results of successive applications toelementary propositions of a finite number of truth-operations.5.4 At this point it becomes manifest that there are no &apos;logicalobjects&apos; or &apos;logical constants&apos; (in Frege&apos;s and Russell&apos;s sense).5.41 The reason is that the results of truth-operations ontruth-functions are always identical whenever they are one and the sametruth-function of elementary propositions.5.42 It is self-evident that C, z, etc. are not relations in the sensein which right and left etc. are relations. The interdefinability ofFrege&apos;s and Russell&apos;s &apos;primitive signs&apos; of logic is enough to show thatthey are not primitive signs, still less signs for relations. And it isobvious that the &apos;z&apos; defined by means of &apos;P&apos; and &apos;C&apos; is identical withthe one that figures with &apos;P&apos; in the definition of &apos;C&apos;; and that thesecond &apos;C&apos; is identical with the first one; and so on.5.43 Even at first sight it seems scarcely credible that there shouldfollow from one fact p infinitely many others, namely PPp, PPPPp, etc.And it is no less remarkable that the infinite number of propositions oflogic (mathematics) follow from half a dozen &apos;primitive propositions&apos;.But in fact all the propositions of logic say the same thing, to witnothing.5.44 Truth-functions are not material functions. For example, anaffirmation can be produced by double negation: in such a case does itfollow that in some sense negation is contained in affirmation? Does&apos;PPp&apos; negate Pp, or does it affirm p--or both? The proposition &apos;PPp&apos; isnot about negation, as if negation were an object: on the other hand,the possibility of negation is already written into affirmation. Andif there were an object called &apos;P&apos;, it would follow that &apos;PPp&apos; saidsomething different from what &apos;p&apos; said, just because the one propositionwould then be about P and the other would not.5.441 This vanishing of the apparent logical constants also occurs inthe case of &apos;P(dx). Pfx&apos;, which says the same as &apos;(x). fx&apos;, and in thecase of &apos;(dx). fx. x = a&apos;, which says the same as &apos;fa&apos;.5.442 If we are given a proposition, then with it we are also given theresults of all truth-operations that have it as their base.5.45 If there are primitive logical signs, then any logic that failsto show clearly how they are placed relatively to one another and tojustify their existence will be incorrect. The construction of logic outof its primitive signs must be made clear.5.451 If logic has primitive ideas, they must be independent of oneanother. If a primitive idea has been introduced, it must have beenintroduced in all the combinations in which it ever occurs. Itcannot, therefore, be introduced first for one combination andlater reintroduced for another. For example, once negation has beenintroduced, we must understand it both in propositions of the form&apos;Pp&apos; and in propositions like &apos;P(p C q)&apos;, &apos;(dx). Pfx&apos;, etc. We must notintroduce it first for the one class of cases and then for the other,since it would then be left in doubt whether its meaning were the samein both cases, and no reason would have been given for combining thesigns in the same way in both cases. (In short, Frege&apos;s remarks aboutintroducing signs by means of definitions (in The Fundamental Lawsof Arithmetic ) also apply, mutatis mutandis, to the introduction ofprimitive signs.)5.452 The introduction of any new device into the symbolism of logicis necessarily a momentous event. In logic a new device should notbe introduced in brackets or in a footnote with what one might calla completely innocent air. (Thus in Russell and Whitehead&apos;s PrincipiaMathematica there occur definitions and primitive propositions expressedin words. Why this sudden appearance of words? It would require ajustification, but none is given, or could be given, since the procedureis in fact illicit.) But if the introduction of a new device has provednecessary at a certain point, we must immediately ask ourselves, &apos;Atwhat points is the employment of this device now unavoidable?&apos; and itsplace in logic must be made clear.5.453 All numbers in logic stand in need of justification. Or rather,it must become evident that there are no numbers in logic. There are nopre-eminent numbers.5.454 In logic there is no co-ordinate status, and there can be noclassification. In logic there can be no distinction between the generaland the specific.5.4541 The solutions of the problems of logic must be simple, since theyset the standard of simplicity. Men have always had a presentimentthat there must be a realm in which the answers to questions aresymmetrically combined--a priori--to form a self-contained system. Arealm subject to the law: Simplex sigillum veri.5.46 If we introduced logical signs properly, then we should also haveintroduced at the same time the sense of all combinations of them; i.e.not only &apos;p C q&apos; but &apos;P(p C q)&apos; as well, etc. etc. We should also haveintroduced at the same time the effect of all possible combinations ofbrackets. And thus it would have been made clear that the real generalprimitive signs are not &apos;p C q&apos;, &apos;(dx). fx&apos;, etc. but the most generalform of their combinations.5.461 Though it seems unimportant, it is in fact significant that thepseudo-relations of logic, such as C and z, need brackets--unlike realrelations. Indeed, the use of brackets with these apparently primitivesigns is itself an indication that they are not primitive signs. Andsurely no one is going to believe brackets have an independent meaning.5.4611 Signs for logical operations are punctuation-marks.5.47 It is clear that whatever we can say in advance about the formof all propositions, we must be able to say all at once. An elementaryproposition really contains all logical operations in itself. For&apos;fa&apos; says the same thing as &apos;(dx). fx. x = a&apos; Wherever there iscompositeness, argument and function are present, and where these arepresent, we already have all the logical constants. One could say thatthe sole logical constant was what all propositions, by their verynature, had in common with one another. But that is the generalpropositional form.5.471 The general propositional form is the essence of a proposition.5.4711 To give the essence of a proposition means to give the essence ofall description, and thus the essence of the world.5.472 The description of the most general propositional form is thedescription of the one and only general primitive sign in logic.5.473 Logic must look after itself. If a sign is possible, then itis also capable of signifying. Whatever is possible in logic is alsopermitted. (The reason why &apos;Socrates is identical&apos; means nothing is thatthere is no property called &apos;identical&apos;. The proposition is nonsensicalbecause we have failed to make an arbitrary determination, and notbecause the symbol, in itself, would be illegitimate.) In a certainsense, we cannot make mistakes in logic.5.4731 Self-evidence, which Russell talked about so much, can becomedispensable in logic, only because language itself prevents everylogical mistake.--What makes logic a priori is the impossibility ofillogical thought.5.4732 We cannot give a sign the wrong sense.5,47321 Occam&apos;s maxim is, of course, not an arbitrary rule, nor one thatis justified by its success in practice: its point is that unnecessaryunits in a sign-language mean nothing. Signs that serve one purposeare logically equivalent, and signs that serve none are logicallymeaningless.5.4733 Frege says that any legitimately constructed proposition musthave a sense. And I say that any possible proposition is legitimatelyconstructed, and, if it has no sense, that can only be because we havefailed to give a meaning to some of its constituents. (Even if we thinkthat we have done so.) Thus the reason why &apos;Socrates is identical&apos; saysnothing is that we have not given any adjectival meaning to the word&apos;identical&apos;. For when it appears as a sign for identity, it symbolizesin an entirely different way--the signifying relation is a differentone--therefore the symbols also are entirely different in the two cases:the two symbols have only the sign in common, and that is an accident.5.474 The number of fundamental operations that are necessary dependssolely on our notation.5.475 All that is required is that we should construct a system of signswith a particular number of dimensions--with a particular mathematicalmultiplicity.5.476 It is clear that this is not a question of a number of primitiveideas that have to be signified, but rather of the expression of a rule.5.5 Every truth-function is a result of successive applications toelementary propositions of the operation &apos;(-----T)(E,....)&apos;. Thisoperation negates all the propositions in the right-hand pair ofbrackets, and I call it the negation of those propositions.5.501 When a bracketed expression has propositions as its terms--and theorder of the terms inside the brackets is indifferent--then I indicateit by a sign of the form &apos;(E)&apos;. &apos;(E)&apos; is a variable whose valuesare terms of the bracketed expression and the bar over the variableindicates that it is the representative of all its values in thebrackets. (E.g. if E has the three values P,Q, R, then (E) = (P, Q, R).) What the values of the variable are is something that is stipulated.The stipulation is a description of the propositions that have thevariable as their representative. How the description of the termsof the bracketed expression is produced is not essential. We candistinguish three kinds of description: 1. Direct enumeration, in whichcase we can simply substitute for the variable the constants that areits values; 2. Giving a function fx whose values for all values of x arethe propositions to be described; 3. Giving a formal law that governsthe construction of the propositions, in which case the bracketedexpression has as its members all the terms of a series of forms.5.502 So instead of &apos;(-----T)(E,....)&apos;, I write &apos;N(E)&apos;. N(E) is thenegation of all the values of the propositional variable E.5.503 It is obvious that we can easily express how propositions may beconstructed with this operation, and how they may not be constructedwith it; so it must be possible to find an exact expression for this.5.51 If E has only one value, then N(E) = Pp (not p); if it has twovalues, then N(E) = Pp. Pq. (neither p nor g).5.511 How can logic--all-embracing logic, which mirrors the world--usesuch peculiar crotchets and contrivances? Only because they are allconnected with one another in an infinitely fine network, the greatmirror.5.512 &apos;Pp&apos; is true if &apos;p&apos; is false. Therefore, in the proposition &apos;Pp&apos;,when it is true, &apos;p&apos; is a false proposition. How then can the stroke &apos;P&apos;make it agree with reality? But in &apos;Pp&apos; it is not &apos;P&apos; that negates, itis rather what is common to all the signs of this notation that negatep. That is to say the common rule that governs the construction of &apos;Pp&apos;,&apos;PPPp&apos;, &apos;Pp C Pp&apos;, &apos;Pp. Pp&apos;, etc. etc. (ad inf.). And this common factormirrors negation.5.513 We might say that what is common to all symbols that affirm both pand q is the proposition &apos;p. q&apos;; and that what is common to all symbolsthat affirm either p or q is the proposition &apos;p C q&apos;. And similarly wecan say that two propositions are opposed to one another if they havenothing in common with one another, and that every proposition has onlyone negative, since there is only one proposition that lies completelyoutside it. Thus in Russell&apos;s notation too it is manifest that &apos;q: p CPp&apos; says the same thing as &apos;q&apos;, that &apos;p C Pq&apos; says nothing.5.514 Once a notation has been established, there will be in it a rulegoverning the construction of all propositions that negate p, a rulegoverning the construction of all propositions that affirm p, and a rulegoverning the construction of all propositions that affirm p or q; andso on. These rules are equivalent to the symbols; and in them theirsense is mirrored.5.515 It must be manifest in our symbols that it can only bepropositions that are combined with one another by &apos;C&apos;, &apos;.&apos;, etc.And this is indeed the case, since the symbol in &apos;p&apos; and &apos;q&apos; itselfpresupposes &apos;C&apos;, &apos;P&apos;, etc. If the sign &apos;p&apos; in &apos;p C q&apos; does not stand fora complex sign, then it cannot have sense by itself: but in that casethe signs &apos;p C p&apos;, &apos;p. p&apos;, etc., which have the same sense as p, mustalso lack sense. But if &apos;p C p&apos; has no sense, then &apos;p C q&apos; cannot have asense either.5.5151 Must the sign of a negative proposition be constructed with thatof the positive proposition? Why should it not be possible to express anegative proposition by means of a negative fact? (E.g. suppose that &quot;a&apos;does not stand in a certain relation to &apos;b&apos;; then this might be usedto say that aRb was not the case.) But really even in this case thenegative proposition is constructed by an indirect use of the positive.The positive proposition necessarily presupposes the existence of thenegative proposition and vice versa.5.52 If E has as its values all the values of a function fx for allvalues of x, then N(E) = P(dx). fx.5.521 I dissociate the concept all from truth-functions. Frege andRussell introduced generality in association with logical productorlogical sum. This made it difficult to understand the propositions&apos;(dx). fx&apos; and &apos;(x) . fx&apos;, in which both ideas are embedded.5.522 What is peculiar to the generality-sign is first, that itindicates a logical prototype, and secondly, that it gives prominence toconstants.5.523 The generality-sign occurs as an argument.5.524 If objects are given, then at the same time we are given allobjects. If elementary propositions are given, then at the same time allelementary propositions are given.5.525 It is incorrect to render the proposition &apos;(dx). fx&apos; in thewords, &apos;fx is possible&apos; as Russell does. The certainty, possibility, orimpossibility of a situation is not expressed by a proposition, butby an expression&apos;s being a tautology, a proposition with a sense, ora contradiction. The precedent to which we are constantly inclined toappeal must reside in the symbol itself.5.526 We can describe the world completely by means of fully generalizedpropositions, i.e. without first correlating any name with a particularobject.5.5261 A fully generalized proposition, like every other proposition, iscomposite. (This is shown by the fact that in &apos;(dx, O). Ox&apos; we haveto mention &apos;O&apos; and &apos;s&apos; separately. They both, independently, stand insignifying relations to the world, just as is the case in ungeneralizedpropositions.) It is a mark of a composite symbol that it has somethingin common with other symbols.5.5262 The truth or falsity of every proposition does make somealteration in the general construction of the world. And the range thatthe totality of elementary propositions leaves open for its constructionis exactly the same as that which is delimited by entirely generalpropositions. (If an elementary proposition is true, that means, at anyrate, one more true elementary proposition.)5.53 Identity of object I express by identity of sign, and not by usinga sign for identity. Difference of objects I express by difference ofsigns.5.5301 It is self-evident that identity is not a relation betweenobjects. This becomes very clear if one considers, for example, theproposition &apos;(x) : fx. z. x = a&apos;. What this proposition says is simplythat only a satisfies the function f, and not that only things that havea certain relation to a satisfy the function, Of course, it might thenbe said that only a did have this relation to a; but in order to expressthat, we should need the identity-sign itself.5.5302 Russell&apos;s definition of &apos;=&apos; is inadequate, because according toit we cannot say that two objects have all their properties in common.(Even if this proposition is never correct, it still has sense.)5.5303 Roughly speaking, to say of two things that they are identical isnonsense, and to say of one thing that it is identical with itself is tosay nothing at all.5.531 Thus I do not write &apos;f(a, b). a = b&apos;, but &apos;f(a, a)&apos; (or &apos;f(b, b));and not &apos;f(a,b). Pa = b&apos;, but &apos;f(a, b)&apos;.5.532 And analogously I do not write &apos;(dx, y). f(x, y). x = y&apos;, but&apos;(dx) . f(x, x)&apos;; and not &apos;(dx, y). f(x, y). Px = y&apos;, but &apos;(dx, y). f(x,y)&apos;. 5.5321 Thus, for example, instead of &apos;(x): fx z x = a&apos; we write&apos;(dx). fx . z: (dx, y). fx. fy&apos;. And the proposition, &apos;Only one xsatisfies f( )&apos;, will read &apos;(dx). fx: P(dx, y). fx. fy&apos;.5.533 The identity-sign, therefore, is not an essential constituent ofconceptual notation.5.534 And now we see that in a correct conceptual notationpseudo-propositions like &apos;a = a&apos;, &apos;a = b. b = c. z a = c&apos;, &apos;(x). x = x&apos;,&apos;(dx). x = a&apos;, etc. cannot even be written down.5.535 This also disposes of all the problems that were connected withsuch pseudo-propositions. All the problems that Russell&apos;s &apos;axiom ofinfinity&apos; brings with it can be solved at this point. What the axiom ofinfinity is intended to say would express itself in language through theexistence of infinitely many names with different meanings.5.5351 There are certain cases in which one is tempted to useexpressions of the form &apos;a = a&apos; or &apos;p z p&apos; and the like. In fact, thishappens when one wants to talk about prototypes, e.g. about proposition,thing, etc. Thus in Russell&apos;s Principles of Mathematics &apos;p is aproposition&apos;--which is nonsense--was given the symbolic rendering &apos;p zp&apos; and placed as an hypothesis in front of certain propositions in orderto exclude from their argument-places everything but propositions. (Itis nonsense to place the hypothesis &apos;p z p&apos; in front of a proposition,in order to ensure that its arguments shall have the right form, if onlybecause with a non-proposition as argument the hypothesis becomes notfalse but nonsensical, and because arguments of the wrong kind make theproposition itself nonsensical, so that it preserves itself from wrongarguments just as well, or as badly, as the hypothesis without sensethat was appended for that purpose.)5.5352 In the same way people have wanted to express, &apos;There areno things &apos;, by writing &apos;P(dx). x = x&apos;. But even if this were aproposition, would it not be equally true if in fact &apos;there were things&apos;but they were not identical with themselves?5.54 In the general propositional form propositions occur in otherpropositions only as bases of truth-operations.5.541 At first sight it looks as if it were also possible for oneproposition to occur in another in a different way. Particularly withcertain forms of proposition in psychology, such as &apos;A believes that pis the case&apos; and A has the thought p&apos;, etc. For if these are consideredsuperficially, it looks as if the proposition p stood in some kind ofrelation to an object A. (And in modern theory of knowledge (Russell,Moore, etc.) these propositions have actually been construed in thisway.)5.542 It is clear, however, that &apos;A believes that p&apos;, &apos;A has the thoughtp&apos;, and &apos;A says p&apos; are of the form &apos;&quot;p&quot; says p&apos;: and this doesnot involve a correlation of a fact with an object, but rather thecorrelation of facts by means of the correlation of their objects.5.5421 This shows too that there is no such thing as the soul--thesubject, etc.--as it is conceived in the superficial psychology of thepresent day. Indeed a composite soul would no longer be a soul.5.5422 The correct explanation of the form of the proposition, &apos;A makesthe judgement p&apos;, must show that it is impossible for a judgement tobe a piece of nonsense. (Russell&apos;s theory does not satisfy thisrequirement.)5.5423 To perceive a complex means to perceive that its constituentsare related to one another in such and such a way. This no doubt alsoexplains why there are two possible ways of seeing the figure as a cube;and all similar phenomena. For we really see two different facts. (If Ilook in the first place at the corners marked a and only glance at theb&apos;s, then the a&apos;s appear to be in front, and vice versa).5.55 We now have to answer a priori the question about all the possibleforms of elementary propositions. Elementary propositions consist ofnames. Since, however, we are unable to give the number of names withdifferent meanings, we are also unable to give the composition ofelementary propositions.5.551 Our fundamental principle is that whenever a question can bedecided by logic at all it must be possible to decide it without moreado. (And if we get into a position where we have to look at the worldfor an answer to such a problem, that shows that we are on a completelywrong track.)5.552 The &apos;experience&apos; that we need in order to understand logic is notthat something or other is the state of things, but that somethingis: that, however, is not an experience. Logic is prior to everyexperience--that something is so. It is prior to the question &apos;How?&apos; notprior to the question &apos;What?&apos;5.5521 And if this were not so, how could we apply logic? We might putit in this way: if there would be a logic even if there were no world,how then could there be a logic given that there is a world?5.553 Russell said that there were simple relations between differentnumbers of things (individuals). But between what numbers? And how isthis supposed to be decided?--By experience? (There is no pre-eminentnumber.)5.554 It would be completely arbitrary to give any specific form.5.5541 It is supposed to be possible to answer a priori the questionwhether I can get into a position in which I need the sign for a27-termed relation in order to signify something.5.5542 But is it really legitimate even to ask such a question? Can weset up a form of sign without knowing whether anything can correspond toit? Does it make sense to ask what there must be in order that somethingcan be the case?5.555 Clearly we have some concept of elementary propositions quiteapart from their particular logical forms. But when there is a system bywhich we can create symbols, the system is what is important for logicand not the individual symbols. And anyway, is it really possible thatin logic I should have to deal with forms that I can invent? What I haveto deal with must be that which makes it possible for me to invent them.5.556 There cannot be a hierarchy of the forms of elementarypropositions. We can foresee only what we ourselves construct.5.5561 Empirical reality is limited by the totality of objects.The limit also makes itself manifest in the totality of elementarypropositions. Hierarchies are and must be independent of reality.5.5562 If we know on purely logical grounds that there must beelementary propositions, then everyone who understands propositions intheir C form must know It.5.5563 In fact, all the propositions of our everyday language, just asthey stand, are in perfect logical order.--That utterly simple thing,which we have to formulate here, is not a likeness of the truth, butthe truth itself in its entirety. (Our problems are not abstract, butperhaps the most concrete that there are.)5.557 The application of logic decides what elementary propositionsthere are. What belongs to its application, logic cannot anticipate. Itis clear that logic must not clash with its application. But logichas to be in contact with its application. Therefore logic and itsapplication must not overlap.5.5571 If I cannot say a priori what elementary propositions there are,then the attempt to do so must lead to obvious nonsense. 5.6 The limitsof my language mean the limits of my world.5.61 Logic pervades the world: the limits of the world are also itslimits. So we cannot say in logic, &apos;The world has this in it, andthis, but not that.&apos; For that would appear to presuppose that we wereexcluding certain possibilities, and this cannot be the case, since itwould require that logic should go beyond the limits of the world; foronly in that way could it view those limits from the other side as well.We cannot think what we cannot think; so what we cannot think we cannotsay either.5.62 This remark provides the key to the problem, how much truth thereis in solipsism. For what the solipsist means is quite correct; only itcannot be said, but makes itself manifest. The world is my world: thisis manifest in the fact that the limits of language (of that languagewhich alone I understand) mean the limits of my world.5.621 The world and life are one.5.63 I am my world. (The microcosm.)5.631 There is no such thing as the subject that thinks or entertainsideas. If I wrote a book called The World as l found it, I should haveto include a report on my body, and should have to say which parts weresubordinate to my will, and which were not, etc., this being a method ofisolating the subject, or rather of showing that in an important sensethere is no subject; for it alone could not be mentioned in that book.--5.632 The subject does not belong to the world: rather, it is a limit ofthe world.5.633 Where in the world is a metaphysical subject to be found? You willsay that this is exactly like the case of the eye and the visual field.But really you do not see the eye. And nothing in the visual fieldallows you to infer that it is seen by an eye.5.6331 For the form of the visual field is surely not like this5.634 This is connected with the fact that no part of our experience isat the same time a priori. Whatever we see could be other than it is.Whatever we can describe at all could be other than it is. There is no apriori order of things.5.64 Here it can be seen that solipsism, when its implications arefollowed out strictly, coincides with pure realism. The self ofsolipsism shrinks to a point without extension, and there remains thereality co-ordinated with it.5.641 Thus there really is a sense in which philosophy can talkabout the self in a non-psychological way. What brings the self intophilosophy is the fact that &apos;the world is my world&apos;. The philosophicalself is not the human being, not the human body, or the human soul, withwhich psychology deals, but rather the metaphysical subject, the limitof the world--not a part of it.6. The general form of a truth-function is [p, E, N(E)].This is the general form of a proposition.6.001 What this says is just that every proposition is a result ofsuccessive applications to elementary propositions of the operation N(E)6.002 If we are given the general form according to which propositionsare constructed, then with it we are also given the general formaccording to which one proposition can be generated out of another bymeans of an operation.6.01 Therefore the general form of an operation /&apos;(n) is [E, N(E)]&apos; (n)( = [n, E, N(E)]). This is the most general form of transition from oneproposition to another.6.02 And this is how we arrive at numbers. I give the followingdefinitions x = /0x Def., /&apos;/v&apos;x = /v+1&apos;x Def. So, in accordance withthese rules, which deal with signs, we write the series x, /&apos;x,/&apos;/&apos;x, /&apos;/&apos;/&apos;x,..., in the following way /0&apos;x, /0+1&apos;x, /0+1+1&apos;x,/0+1+1+1&apos;x,.... Therefore, instead of &apos;[x, E, /&apos;E]&apos;, I write &apos;[/0&apos;x,/v&apos;x, /v+1&apos;x]&apos;. And I give the following definitions 0 + 1 = 1 Def., 0 +1 + 1 = 2 Def., 0 + 1 + 1 +1 = 3 Def., (and so on).6.021 A number is the exponent of an operation.6.022 The concept of number is simply what is common to all numbers, thegeneral form of a number. The concept of number is the variable number.And the concept of numerical equality is the general form of allparticular cases of numerical equality.6.03 The general form of an integer is [0, E, E +1].6.031 The theory of classes is completely superfluous in mathematics.This is connected with the fact that the generality required inmathematics is not accidental generality.6.1 The propositions of logic are tautologies.6.11 Therefore the propositions of logic say nothing. (They are theanalytic propositions.)6.111 All theories that make a proposition of logic appear to havecontent are false. One might think, for example, that the words &apos;true&apos;and &apos;false&apos; signified two properties among other properties, and then itwould seem to be a remarkable fact that every proposition possessed oneof these properties. On this theory it seems to be anything but obvious,just as, for instance, the proposition, &apos;All roses are either yellow orred&apos;, would not sound obvious even if it were true. Indeed, the logicalproposition acquires all the characteristics of a proposition of naturalscience and this is the sure sign that it has been construed wrongly.6.112 The correct explanation of the propositions of logic must assignto them a unique status among all propositions.6.113 It is the peculiar mark of logical propositions that one canrecognize that they are true from the symbol alone, and this factcontains in itself the whole philosophy of logic. And so too it isa very important fact that the truth or falsity of non-logicalpropositions cannot be recognized from the propositions alone.6.12 The fact that the propositions of logic are tautologies shows theformal--logical--properties of language and the world. The fact thata tautology is yielded by this particular way of connecting itsconstituents characterizes the logic of its constituents. Ifpropositions are to yield a tautology when they are connected in acertain way, they must have certain structural properties. So theiryielding a tautology when combined in this shows that they possess thesestructural properties.6.1201 For example, the fact that the propositions &apos;p&apos; and &apos;Pp&apos; in thecombination &apos;(p. Pp)&apos; yield a tautology shows that they contradict oneanother. The fact that the propositions &apos;p z q&apos;, &apos;p&apos;, and &apos;q&apos;, combinedwith one another in the form &apos;(p z q). (p):z: (q)&apos;, yield a tautologyshows that q follows from p and p z q. The fact that &apos;(x). fxx:z: fa&apos; isa tautology shows that fa follows from (x). fx. Etc. etc.6.1202 It is clear that one could achieve the same purpose by usingcontradictions instead of tautologies.6.1203 In order to recognize an expression as a tautology, in caseswhere no generality-sign occurs in it, one can employ the followingintuitive method: instead of &apos;p&apos;, &apos;q&apos;, &apos;r&apos;, etc. I write &apos;TpF&apos;, &apos;TqF&apos;,&apos;TrF&apos;, etc. Truth-combinations I express by means of brackets, e.g. andI use lines to express the correlation of the truth or falsity of thewhole proposition with the truth-combinations of its truth-arguments,in the following way So this sign, for instance, would representthe proposition p z q. Now, by way of example, I wish to examine theproposition P(p.Pp) (the law of contradiction) in order to determinewhether it is a tautology. In our notation the form &apos;PE&apos; is written asand the form &apos;E. n&apos; as Hence the proposition P(p. Pp). reads as followsIf we here substitute &apos;p&apos; for &apos;q&apos; and examine how the outermost T and Fare connected with the innermost ones, the result will be that the truthof the whole proposition is correlated with all the truth-combinationsof its argument, and its falsity with none of the truth-combinations.6.121 The propositions of logic demonstrate the logical propertiesof propositions by combining them so as to form propositions that saynothing. This method could also be called a zero-method. In a logicalproposition, propositions are brought into equilibrium with oneanother, and the state of equilibrium then indicates what the logicalconstitution of these propositions must be.6.122 It follows from this that we can actually do without logicalpropositions; for in a suitable notation we can in fact recognize theformal properties of propositions by mere inspection of the propositionsthemselves.6.1221 If, for example, two propositions &apos;p&apos; and &apos;q&apos; in the combination&apos;p z q&apos; yield a tautology, then it is clear that q follows from p. Forexample, we see from the two propositions themselves that &apos;q&apos; followsfrom &apos;p z q. p&apos;, but it is also possible to show it in this way: wecombine them to form &apos;p z q. p:z: q&apos;, and then show that this is atautology.6.1222 This throws some light on the question why logical propositionscannot be confirmed by experience any more than they can be refuted byit. Not only must a proposition of logic be irrefutable by anypossible experience, but it must also be unconfirmable by any possibleexperience.6.1223 Now it becomes clear why people have often felt as if it werefor us to &apos;postulate&apos; the &apos;truths of logic&apos;. The reason is that we canpostulate them in so far as we can postulate an adequate notation.6.1224 It also becomes clear now why logic was called the theory offorms and of inference.6.123 Clearly the laws of logic cannot in their turn be subject tolaws of logic. (There is not, as Russell thought, a special law ofcontradiction for each &apos;type&apos;; one law is enough, since it is notapplied to itself.)6.1231 The mark of a logical proposition is not general validity. To begeneral means no more than to be accidentally valid for all things.An ungeneralized proposition can be tautological just as well as ageneralized one.6.1232 The general validity of logic might be called essential, incontrast with the accidental general validity of such propositionsas &apos;All men are mortal&apos;. Propositions like Russell&apos;s &apos;axiom ofreducibility&apos; are not logical propositions, and this explains ourfeeling that, even if they were true, their truth could only be theresult of a fortunate accident.6.1233 It is possible to imagine a world in which the axiom ofreducibility is not valid. It is clear, however, that logic has nothingto do with the question whether our world really is like that or not.6.124 The propositions of logic describe the scaffolding of the world,or rather they represent it. They have no &apos;subject-matter&apos;. Theypresuppose that names have meaning and elementary propositions sense;and that is their connexion with the world. It is clear that somethingabout the world must be indicated by the fact that certain combinationsof symbols--whose essence involves the possession of a determinatecharacter--are tautologies. This contains the decisive point. We havesaid that some things are arbitrary in the symbols that we use and thatsome things are not. In logic it is only the latter that express: butthat means that logic is not a field in which we express what we wishwith the help of signs, but rather one in which the nature of theabsolutely necessary signs speaks for itself. If we know the logicalsyntax of any sign-language, then we have already been given all thepropositions of logic.6.125 It is possible--indeed possible even according to the oldconception of logic--to give in advance a description of all &apos;true&apos;logical propositions.6.1251 Hence there can never be surprises in logic.6.126 One can calculate whether a proposition belongs to logic, bycalculating the logical properties of the symbol. And this is what wedo when we &apos;prove&apos; a logical proposition. For, without bothering aboutsense or meaning, we construct the logical proposition out of othersusing only rules that deal with signs. The proof of logical propositionsconsists in the following process: we produce them out of other logicalpropositions by successively applying certain operations that alwaysgenerate further tautologies out of the initial ones. (And in fact onlytautologies follow from a tautology.) Of course this way of showing thatthe propositions of logic are tautologies is not at all essential tologic, if only because the propositions from which the proof starts mustshow without any proof that they are tautologies.6.1261 In logic process and result are equivalent. (Hence the absence ofsurprise.)6.1262 Proof in logic is merely a mechanical expedient to facilitate therecognition of tautologies in complicated cases.6.1263 Indeed, it would be altogether too remarkable if a propositionthat had sense could be proved logically from others, and so too could alogical proposition. It is clear from the start that a logical proof ofa proposition that has sense and a proof in logic must be two entirelydifferent things.6.1264 A proposition that has sense states something, which is shown byits proof to be so. In logic every proposition is the form of a proof.Every proposition of logic is a modus ponens represented in signs. (Andone cannot express the modus ponens by means of a proposition.)6.1265 It is always possible to construe logic in such a way that everyproposition is its own proof.6.127 All the propositions of logic are of equal status: it is notthe case that some of them are essentially derived propositions. Everytautology itself shows that it is a tautology.6.1271 It is clear that the number of the &apos;primitive propositionsof logic&apos; is arbitrary, since one could derive logic from a singleprimitive proposition, e.g. by simply constructing the logical productof Frege&apos;s primitive propositions. (Frege would perhaps say thatwe should then no longer have an immediately self-evident primitiveproposition. But it is remarkable that a thinker as rigorous as Fregeappealed to the degree of self-evidence as the criterion of a logicalproposition.)6.13 Logic is not a body of doctrine, but a mirror-image of the world.Logic is transcendental.6.2 Mathematics is a logical method. The propositions of mathematics areequations, and therefore pseudo-propositions.6.21 A proposition of mathematics does not express a thought.6.211 Indeed in real life a mathematical proposition is never whatwe want. Rather, we make use of mathematical propositions only ininferences from propositions that do not belong to mathematics to othersthat likewise do not belong to mathematics. (In philosophy the question,&apos;What do we actually use this word or this proposition for?&apos; repeatedlyleads to valuable insights.)6.22 The logic of the world, which is shown in tautologies by thepropositions of logic, is shown in equations by mathematics.6.23 If two expressions are combined by means of the sign of equality,that means that they can be substituted for one another. But it must bemanifest in the two expressions themselves whether this is the caseor not. When two expressions can be substituted for one another, thatcharacterizes their logical form.6.231 It is a property of affirmation that it can be construed as doublenegation. It is a property of &apos;1 + 1 + 1 + 1&apos; that it can be construedas &apos;(1 + 1) + (1 + 1)&apos;.6.232 Frege says that the two expressions have the same meaning butdifferent senses. But the essential point about an equation is that itis not necessary in order to show that the two expressions connected bythe sign of equality have the same meaning, since this can be seen fromthe two expressions themselves.6.2321 And the possibility of proving the propositions of mathematicsmeans simply that their correctness can be perceived without its beingnecessary that what they express should itself be compared with thefacts in order to determine its correctness.6.2322 It is impossible to assert the identity of meaning of twoexpressions. For in order to be able to assert anything about theirmeaning, I must know their meaning, and I cannot know their meaningwithout knowing whether what they mean is the same or different.6.2323 An equation merely marks the point of view from which I considerthe two expressions: it marks their equivalence in meaning.6.233 The question whether intuition is needed for the solution ofmathematical problems must be given the answer that in this caselanguage itself provides the necessary intuition.6.2331 The process of calculating serves to bring about that intuition.Calculation is not an experiment.6.234 Mathematics is a method of logic.6.2341 It is the essential characteristic of mathematical method thatit employs equations. For it is because of this method that everyproposition of mathematics must go without saying.6.24 The method by which mathematics arrives at its equations is themethod of substitution. For equations express the substitutability oftwo expressions and, starting from a number of equations, we advance tonew equations by substituting different expressions in accordance withthe equations.6.241 Thus the proof of the proposition 2 t 2 = 4 runs as follows:(/v)n&apos;x = /v x u&apos;x Def., /2 x 2&apos;x = (/2)2&apos;x = (/2)1 + 1&apos;x = /2&apos; /2&apos;x =/1 + 1&apos;/1 + 1&apos;x = (/&apos;/)&apos;(/&apos;/)&apos;x =/&apos;/&apos;/&apos;/&apos;x = /1 + 1 + 1 + 1&apos;x = /4&apos;x.6.3 The exploration of logic means the exploration of everything that issubject to law. And outside logic everything is accidental.6.31 The so-called law of induction cannot possibly be a law of logic,since it is obviously a proposition with sense.---Nor, therefore, can itbe an a priori law.6.32 The law of causality is not a law but the form of a law.6.321 &apos;Law of causality&apos;--that is a general name. And just as inmechanics, for example, there are &apos;minimum-principles&apos;, such as the lawof least action, so too in physics there are causal laws, laws of thecausal form.6.3211 Indeed people even surmised that there must be a &apos;law of leastaction&apos; before they knew exactly how it went. (Here, as always, what iscertain a priori proves to be something purely logical.)6.33 We do not have an a priori belief in a law of conservation, butrather a priori knowledge of the possibility of a logical form.6.34 All such propositions, including the principle of sufficientreason, tile laws of continuity in nature and of least effort in nature,etc. etc.--all these are a priori insights about the forms in which thepropositions of science can be cast.6.341 Newtonian mechanics, for example, imposes a unified form on thedescription of the world. Let us imagine a white surface with irregularblack spots on it. We then say that whatever kind of picture these make,I can always approximate as closely as I wish to the description of itby covering the surface with a sufficiently fine square mesh, and thensaying of every square whether it is black or white. In this way I shallhave imposed a unified form on the description of the surface. The formis optional, since I could have achieved the same result by using a netwith a triangular or hexagonal mesh. Possibly the use of a triangularmesh would have made the description simpler: that is to say, it mightbe that we could describe the surface more accurately with a coarsetriangular mesh than with a fine square mesh (or conversely), and so on.The different nets correspond to different systems for describing theworld. Mechanics determines one form of description of the world bysaying that all propositions used in the description of the world mustbe obtained in a given way from a given set of propositions--the axiomsof mechanics. It thus supplies the bricks for building the edifice ofscience, and it says, &apos;Any building that you want to erect, whatever itmay be, must somehow be constructed with these bricks, and with thesealone.&apos; (Just as with the number-system we must be able to write downany number we wish, so with the system of mechanics we must be able towrite down any proposition of physics that we wish.)6.342 And now we can see the relative position of logic and mechanics.(The net might also consist of more than one kind of mesh: e.g. wecould use both triangles and hexagons.) The possibility of describing apicture like the one mentioned above with a net of a given form tells usnothing about the picture. (For that is true of all such pictures.)But what does characterize the picture is that it can be describedcompletely by a particular net with a particular size of mesh. Similarlythe possibility of describing the world by means of Newtonian mechanicstells us nothing about the world: but what does tell us something aboutit is the precise way in which it is possible to describe it by thesemeans. We are also told something about the world by the fact that itcan be described more simply with one system of mechanics than withanother.6.343 Mechanics is an attempt to construct according to a single planall the true propositions that we need for the description of the world.6.3431 The laws of physics, with all their logical apparatus, stillspeak, however indirectly, about the objects of the world.6.3432 We ought not to forget that any description of the world by meansof mechanics will be of the completely general kind. For example, itwill never mention particular point-masses: it will only talk about anypoint-masses whatsoever.6.35 Although the spots in our picture are geometrical figures,nevertheless geometry can obviously say nothing at all about theiractual form and position. The network, however, is purely geometrical;all its properties can be given a priori. Laws like the principle ofsufficient reason, etc. are about the net and not about what the netdescribes.6.36 If there were a law of causality, it might be put in the followingway: There are laws of nature. But of course that cannot be said: itmakes itself manifest.6.361 One might say, using Hertt:&apos;s terminology, that only connexionsthat are subject to law are thinkable.6.3611 We cannot compare a process with &apos;the passage of time&apos;--there isno such thing--but only with another process (such as the working of achronometer). Hence we can describe the lapse of time only by relying onsome other process. Something exactly analogous applies to space: e.g.when people say that neither of two events (which exclude one another)can occur, because there is nothing to cause the one to occur ratherthan the other, it is really a matter of our being unable to describeone of the two events unless there is some sort of asymmetry to befound. And if such an asymmetry is to be found, we can regard it as thecause of the occurrence of the one and the non-occurrence of the other.6.36111 Kant&apos;s problem about the right hand and the left hand, whichcannot be made to coincide, exists even in two dimensions. Indeed, itexists in one-dimensional space in which the two congruent figures,a and b, cannot be made to coincide unless they are moved out ofthis space. The right hand and the left hand are in fact completelycongruent. It is quite irrelevant that they cannot be made to coincide.A right-hand glove could be put on the left hand, if it could be turnedround in four-dimensional space.6.362 What can be described can happen too: and what the law ofcausality is meant to exclude cannot even be described.6.363 The procedure of induction consists in accepting as true thesimplest law that can be reconciled with our experiences.6.3631 This procedure, however, has no logical justification but only apsychological one. It is clear that there are no grounds for believingthat the simplest eventuality will in fact be realized.6.36311 It is an hypothesis that the sun will rise tomorrow: and thismeans that we do not know whether it will rise.6.37 There is no compulsion making one thing happen because another hashappened. The only necessity that exists is logical necessity.6.371 The whole modern conception of the world is founded on theillusion that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations ofnatural phenomena.6.372 Thus people today stop at the laws of nature, treating them assomething inviolable, just as God and Fate were treated in past ages.And in fact both are right and both wrong: though the view of theancients is clearer in so far as they have a clear and acknowledgedterminus, while the modern system tries to make it look as if everythingwere explained.6.373 The world is independent of my will.6.374 Even if all that we wish for were to happen, still this wouldonly be a favour granted by fate, so to speak: for there is no logicalconnexion between the will and the world, which would guarantee it, andthe supposed physical connexion itself is surely not something that wecould will.6.375 Just as the only necessity that exists is logical necessity, sotoo the only impossibility that exists is logical impossibility.6.3751 For example, the simultaneous presence of two colours at the sameplace in the visual field is impossible, in fact logically impossible,since it is ruled out by the logical structure of colour. Let us thinkhow this contradiction appears in physics: more or less as follows--aparticle cannot have two velocities at the same time; that is to say, itcannot be in two places at the same time; that is to say, particles thatare in different places at the same time cannot be identical. (Itis clear that the logical product of two elementary propositions canneither be a tautology nor a contradiction. The statement that a pointin the visual field has two different colours at the same time is acontradiction.)6.4 All propositions are of equal value.6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the worldeverything is as it is, and everything happens as it does happen: in itno value exists--and if it did exist, it would have no value. If thereis any value that does have value, it must lie outside the whole sphereof what happens and is the case. For all that happens and is the caseis accidental. What makes it non-accidental cannot lie within the world,since if it did it would itself be accidental. It must lie outside theworld.6.42 So too it is impossible for there to be propositions of ethics.Propositions can express nothing that is higher.6.421 It is clear that ethics cannot be put into words. Ethics istranscendental. (Ethics and aesthetics are one and the same.)6.422 When an ethical law of the form, &apos;Thou shalt...&apos; is laid down,one&apos;s first thought is, &apos;And what if I do, not do it?&apos; It is clear,however, that ethics has nothing to do with punishment and reward in theusual sense of the terms. So our question about the consequences of anaction must be unimportant.--At least those consequences should not beevents. For there must be something right about the question we posed.There must indeed be some kind of ethical reward and ethical punishment,but they must reside in the action itself. (And it is also clear thatthe reward must be something pleasant and the punishment somethingunpleasant.)6.423 It is impossible to speak about the will in so far as it isthe subject of ethical attributes. And the will as a phenomenon is ofinterest only to psychology.6.43 If the good or bad exercise of the will does alter the world, itcan alter only the limits of the world, not the facts--not what canbe expressed by means of language. In short the effect must be that itbecomes an altogether different world. It must, so to speak, wax andwane as a whole. The world of the happy man is a different one from thatof the unhappy man.6.431 So too at death the world does not alter, but comes to an end.6.4311 Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experiencedeath. If we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal durationbut timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in thepresent. Our life has no end in just the way in which our visual fieldhas no limits.6.4312 Not only is there no guarantee of the temporal immortality of thehuman soul, that is to say of its eternal survival after death; but, inany case, this assumption completely fails to accomplish the purposefor which it has always been intended. Or is some riddle solved by mysurviving for ever? Is not this eternal life itself as much of a riddleas our present life? The solution of the riddle of life in space andtime lies outside space and time. (It is certainly not the solution ofany problems of natural science that is required.)6.432 How things are in the world is a matter of complete indifferencefor what is higher. God does not reveal himself in the world.6.4321 The facts all contribute only to setting the problem, not to itssolution.6.44 It is not how things are in the world that is mystical, but that itexists.6.45 To view the world sub specie aeterni is to view it as a whole--alimited whole. Feeling the world as a limited whole--it is this that ismystical.6.5 When the answer cannot be put into words, neither can the questionbe put into words. The riddle does not exist. If a question can beframed at all, it is also possible to answer it.6.51 Scepticism is not irrefutable, but obviously nonsensical, when ittries to raise doubts where no questions can be asked. For doubt canexist only where a question exists, a question only where an answerexists, and an answer only where something can be said.6.52 We feel that even when all possible scientific questions have beenanswered, the problems of life remain completely untouched. Of coursethere are then no questions left, and this itself is the answer.6.521 The solution of the problem of life is seen in the vanishing ofthe problem. (Is not this the reason why those who have found after along period of doubt that the sense of life became clear to them havethen been unable to say what constituted that sense?)6.522 There are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. They makethemselves manifest. They are what is mystical.6.53 The correct method in philosophy would really be the following:to say nothing except what can be said, i.e. propositions of naturalscience--i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy--andthen, whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical, todemonstrate to him that he had failed to give a meaning to certain signsin his propositions. Although it would not be satisfying to theother person--he would not have the feeling that we were teaching himphilosophy--this method would be the only strictly correct one.6.54 My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands mefinally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out throughthem, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder,after he has climbed up on it.) He must transcend these propositions,and then he will see the world aright.7. What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.</text>

\par
1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.\par
\par
1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by their being all the\par
facts.\par
\par
1.12 For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and also\par
whatever is not the case.\par
\par
1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.\par
\par
1.2 The world divides into facts.\par
\par
1.21 Each item can be the case or not the case while everything else\par
remains the same.\par
\par
2. What is the case--a fact--is the existence of states of affairs.\par
\par
2.01 A state of affairs (a state of things) is a combination of objects\par
(things).\par
\par
2.011 It is essential to things that they should be possible\par
constituents of states of affairs.\par
\par
2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in a state\par
of affairs, the possibility of the state of affairs must be written into\par
the thing itself.\par
\par
2.0121 It would seem to be a sort of accident, if it turned out that\par
a situation would fit a thing that could already exist entirely on its\par
own. If things can occur in states of affairs, this possibility must\par
be in them from the beginning. (Nothing in the province of logic can\par
be merely possible. Logic deals with every possibility and all\par
possibilities are its facts.) Just as we are quite unable to imagine\par
spatial objects outside space or temporal objects outside time, so too\par
there is no object that we can imagine excluded from the possibility of\par
combining with others. If I can imagine objects combined in states of\par
affairs, I cannot imagine them excluded from the possibility of such\par
combinations.\par
\par
2.0122 Things are independent in so far as they can occur in all\par
possible situations, but this form of independence is a form of\par
connexion with states of affairs, a form of dependence. (It is\par
impossible for words to appear in two different roles: by themselves,\par
and in propositions.)\par
\par
2.0123 If I know an object I also know all its possible occurrences in\par
states of affairs. (Every one of these possibilities must be part of the\par
nature of the object.) A new possibility cannot be discovered later.\par
\par
2.01231 If I am to know an object, though I need not know its external\par
properties, I must know all its internal properties.\par
\par
2.0124 If all objects are given, then at the same time all possible\par
states of affairs are also given.\par
\par
2.013 Each thing is, as it were, in a space of possible states of\par
affairs. This space I can imagine empty, but I cannot imagine the thing\par
without the space.\par
\par
2.0131 A spatial object must be situated in infinite space. (A spatial\par
point is an argument-place.) A speck in the visual field, thought it\par
need not be red, must have some colour: it is, so to speak, surrounded\par
by colour-space. Notes must have some pitch, objects of the sense of\par
touch some degree of hardness, and so on.\par
\par
2.014 Objects contain the possibility of all situations.\par
\par
2.0141 The possibility of its occurring in states of affairs is the form\par
of an object.\par
\par
2.02 Objects are simple.\par
\par
2.0201 Every statement about complexes can be resolved into a statement\par
about their constituents and into the propositions that describe the\par
complexes completely.\par
\par
2.021 Objects make up the substance of the world. That is why they\par
cannot be composite.\par
\par
2.0211 If the world had no substance, then whether a proposition had\par
sense would depend on whether another proposition was true.\par
\par
2.0212 In that case we could not sketch any picture of the world (true\par
or false).\par
\par
2.022 It is obvious that an imagined world, however different it may be\par
from the real one, must have something--a form--in common with it.\par
\par
2.023 Objects are just what constitute this unalterable form.\par
\par
2.0231 The substance of the world can only determine a form, and not\par
any material properties. For it is only by means of propositions that\par
material properties are represented--only by the configuration of\par
objects that they are produced.\par
\par
2.0232 In a manner of speaking, objects are colourless.\par
\par
2.0233 If two objects have the same logical form, the only distinction\par
between them, apart from their external properties, is that they are\par
different.\par
\par
2.02331 Either a thing has properties that nothing else has, in which\par
case we can immediately use a description to distinguish it from the\par
others and refer to it; or, on the other hand, there are several things\par
that have the whole set of their properties in common, in which case it\par
is quite impossible to indicate one of them. For if there is nothing to\par
distinguish a thing, I cannot distinguish it, since otherwise it would\par
be distinguished after all.\par
\par
2.024 The substance is what subsists independently of what is the case.\par
\par
2.025 It is form and content.\par
\par
2.0251 Space, time, colour (being coloured) are forms of objects.\par
\par
2.026 There must be objects, if the world is to have unalterable form.\par
\par
2.027 Objects, the unalterable, and the subsistent are one and the same.\par
\par
2.0271 Objects are what is unalterable and subsistent; their\par
configuration is what is changing and unstable.\par
\par
2.0272 The configuration of objects produces states of affairs.\par
\par
2.03 In a state of affairs objects fit into one another like the links\par
of a chain.\par
\par
2.031 In a state of affairs objects stand in a determinate relation to\par
one another.\par
\par
2.032 The determinate way in which objects are connected in a state of\par
affairs is the structure of the state of affairs.\par
\par
2.033 Form is the possibility of structure.\par
\par
2.034 The structure of a fact consists of the structures of states of\par
affairs.\par
\par
2.04 The totality of existing states of affairs is the world.\par
\par
2.05 The totality of existing states of affairs also determines which\par
states of affairs do not exist.\par
\par
2.06 The existence and non-existence of states of affairs is reality.\par
(We call the existence of states of affairs a positive fact, and their\par
non-existence a negative fact.)\par
\par
2.061 States of affairs are independent of one another.\par
\par
2.062 From the existence or non-existence of one state of affairs it is\par
impossible to infer the existence or non-existence of another.\par
\par
2.063 The sum-total of reality is the world.\par
\par
2.1 We picture facts to ourselves.\par
\par
2.11 A picture presents a situation in logical space, the existence and\par
non-existence of states of affairs.\par
\par
2.12 A picture is a model of reality.\par
\par
2.13 In a picture objects have the elements of the picture corresponding\par
to them.\par
\par
2.131 In a picture the elements of the picture are the representatives\par
of objects.\par
\par
2.14 What constitutes a picture is that its elements are related to one\par
another in a determinate way.\par
\par
2.141 A picture is a fact.\par
\par
2.15 The fact that the elements of a picture are related to one another\par
in a determinate way represents that things are related to one another\par
in the same way. Let us call this connexion of its elements the\par
structure of the picture, and let us call the possibility of this\par
structure the pictorial form of the picture.\par
\par
2.151 Pictorial form is the possibility that things are related to one\par
another in the same way as the elements of the picture.\par
\par
2.1511 That is how a picture is attached to reality; it reaches right\par
out to it.\par
\par
2.1512 It is laid against reality like a measure.\par
\par
2.15121 Only the end-points of the graduating lines actually touch the\par
object that is to be measured.\par
\par
2.1514 So a picture, conceived in this way, also includes the pictorial\par
relationship, which makes it into a picture.\par
\par
2.1515 These correlations are, as it were, the feelers of the picture&apos;s\par
elements, with which the picture touches reality.\par
\par
2.16 If a fact is to be a picture, it must have something in common with\par
what it depicts.\par
\par
2.161 There must be something identical in a picture and what it\par
depicts, to enable the one to be a picture of the other at all.\par
\par
2.17 What a picture must have in common with reality, in order to be\par
able to depict it--correctly or incorrectly--in the way that it does, is\par
its pictorial form.\par
\par
2.171 A picture can depict any reality whose form it has. A spatial\par
picture can depict anything spatial, a coloured one anything coloured,\par
etc.\par
\par
2.172 A picture cannot, however, depict its pictorial form: it displays\par
it.\par
\par
2.173 A picture represents its subject from a position outside it.\par
(Its standpoint is its representational form.) That is why a picture\par
represents its subject correctly or incorrectly.\par
\par
2.174 A picture cannot, however, place itself outside its\par
representational form.\par
\par
2.18 What any picture, of whatever form, must have in common with\par
reality, in order to be able to depict it--correctly or incorrectly--in\par
any way at all, is logical form, i.e. the form of reality.\par
\par
2.181 A picture whose pictorial form is logical form is called a logical\par
picture.\par
\par
2.182 Every picture is at the same time a logical one. (On the other\par
hand, not every picture is, for example, a spatial one.)\par
\par
2.19 Logical pictures can depict the world.\par
\par
2.2 A picture has logico-pictorial form in common with what it depicts.\par
\par
2.201 A picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of\par
existence and non-existence of states of affairs.\par
\par
2.202 A picture contains the possibility of the situation that it\par
represents.\par
\par
2.203 A picture agrees with reality or fails to agree; it is correct or\par
incorrect, true or false.\par
\par
2.22 What a picture represents it represents independently of its truth\par
or falsity, by means of its pictorial form.\par
\par
2.221 What a picture represents is its sense.\par
\par
2.222 The agreement or disagreement or its sense with reality\par
constitutes its truth or falsity.\par
\par
2.223 In order to tell whether a picture is true or false we must\par
compare it with reality.\par
\par
2.224 It is impossible to tell from the picture alone whether it is true\par
or false.\par
\par
2.225 There are no pictures that are true a priori.\par
\par
\par
\par
3. A logical picture of facts is a thought.\par
\par
3.001 &apos;A state of affairs is thinkable&apos;: what this means is that we can\par
picture it to ourselves.\par
\par
3.01 The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.\par
\par
3.02 A thought contains the possibility of the situation of which it is\par
the thought. What is thinkable is possible too.\par
\par
3.03 Thought can never be of anything illogical, since, if it were, we\par
should have to think illogically.\par
\par
3.031 It used to be said that God could create anything except what\par
would be contrary to the laws of logic. The truth is that we could not\par
say what an &apos;illogical&apos; world would look like.\par
\par
3.032 It is as impossible to represent in language anything that\par
&apos;contradicts logic&apos; as it is in geometry to represent by its coordinates\par
a figure that contradicts the laws of space, or to give the coordinates\par
of a point that does not exist.\par
\par
3.0321 Though a state of affairs that would contravene the laws of\par
physics can be represented by us spatially, one that would contravene\par
the laws of geometry cannot.\par
\par
3.04 If a thought were correct a priori, it would be a thought whose\par
possibility ensured its truth.\par
\par
3.05 A priori knowledge that a thought was true would be possible only\par
if its truth were recognizable from the thought itself (without anything\par
a to compare it with).\par
\par
3.1 In a proposition a thought finds an expression that can be perceived\par
by the senses.\par
\par
3.11 We use the perceptible sign of a proposition (spoken or written,\par
etc.) as a projection of a possible situation. The method of projection\par
is to think of the sense of the proposition.\par
\par
3.12 I call the sign with which we express a thought a propositional\par
sign. And a proposition is a propositional sign in its projective\par
relation to the world.\par
\par
3.13 A proposition, therefore, does not actually contain its sense,\par
but does contain the possibility of expressing it. (&apos;The content of\par
a proposition&apos; means the content of a proposition that has sense.) A\par
proposition contains the form, but not the content, of its sense.\par
\par
3.14 What constitutes a propositional sign is that in its elements (the\par
words) stand in a determinate relation to one another. A propositional\par
sign is a fact.\par
\par
3.141 A proposition is not a blend of words.(Just as a theme in music is\par
not a blend of notes.) A proposition is articulate.\par
\par
3.142 Only facts can express a sense, a set of names cannot.\par
\par
3.143 Although a propositional sign is a fact, this is obscured by\par
the usual form of expression in writing or print. For in a printed\par
proposition, for example, no essential difference is apparent between a\par
propositional sign and a word. (That is what made it possible for Frege\par
to call a proposition a composite name.)\par
\par
3.1431 The essence of a propositional sign is very clearly seen if we\par
imagine one composed of spatial objects (such as tables, chairs, and\par
books) instead of written signs.\par
\par
3.1432 Instead of, &apos;The complex sign &quot;aRb&quot; says that a stands to b in\par
the relation R&apos; we ought to put, &apos;That &quot;a&quot; stands to &quot;b&quot; in a certain\par
relation says that aRb.&apos;\par
\par
3.144 Situations can be described but not given names.\par
\par
3.2 In a proposition a thought can be expressed in such a way that\par
elements of the propositional sign correspond to the objects of the\par
thought.\par
\par
3.201 I call such elements &apos;simple signs&apos;, and such a proposition\par
&apos;complete analysed&apos;.\par
\par
3.202 The simple signs employed in propositions are called names.\par
\par
3.203 A name means an object. The object is its meaning. (&apos;A&apos; is the\par
same sign as &apos;A&apos;.)\par
\par
3.21 The configuration of objects in a situation corresponds to the\par
configuration of simple signs in the propositional sign.\par
\par
3.221 Objects can only be named. Signs are their representatives. I can\par
only speak about them: I cannot put them into words. Propositions can\par
only say how things are, not what they are.\par
\par
3.23 The requirement that simple signs be possible is the requirement\par
that sense be determinate.\par
\par
3.24 A proposition about a complex stands in an internal relation to a\par
proposition about a constituent of the complex. A complex can be given\par
only by its description, which will be right or wrong. A proposition\par
that mentions a complex will not be nonsensical, if the complex does\par
not exits, but simply false. When a propositional element signifies a\par
complex, this can be seen from an indeterminateness in the propositions\par
in which it occurs. In such cases we know that the proposition leaves\par
something undetermined. (In fact the notation for generality contains\par
a prototype.) The contraction of a symbol for a complex into a simple\par
symbol can be expressed in a definition.\par
\par
3.25 A proposition cannot be dissected any further by means of a\par
definition: it is a primitive sign.\par
\par
3.261 Every sign that has a definition signifies via the signs that\par
serve to define it; and the definitions point the way. Two signs cannot\par
signify in the same manner if one is primitive and the other is defined\par
by means of primitive signs. Names cannot be anatomized by means of\par
definitions. (Nor can any sign that has a meaning independently and on\par
its own.)\par
\par
3.262 What signs fail to express, their application shows. What signs\par
slur over, their application says clearly.\par
\par
3.263 The meanings of primitive signs can be explained by means of\par
elucidations. Elucidations are propositions that stood if the meanings\par
of those signs are already known.\par
\par
3.3 Only propositions have sense; only in the nexus of a proposition\par
does a name have meaning.\par
\par
3.31 I call any part of a proposition that characterizes its sense\par
an expression (or a symbol). (A proposition is itself an expression.)\par
Everything essential to their sense that propositions can have in common\par
with one another is an expression. An expression is the mark of a form\par
and a content.\par
\par
3.311 An expression presupposes the forms of all the propositions in\par
which it can occur. It is the common characteristic mark of a class of\par
propositions.\par
\par
3.312 It is therefore presented by means of the general form of the\par
propositions that it characterizes. In fact, in this form the expression\par
will be constant and everything else variable.\par
\par
3.313 Thus an expression is presented by means of a variable whose\par
values are the propositions that contain the expression. (In the\par
limiting case the variable becomes a constant, the expression becomes a\par
proposition.) I call such a variable a &apos;propositional variable&apos;.\par
\par
3.314 An expression has meaning only in a proposition. All variables can\par
be construed as propositional variables. (Even variable names.)\par
\par
3.315 If we turn a constituent of a proposition into a variable, there\par
is a class of propositions all of which are values of the resulting\par
variable proposition. In general, this class too will be dependent on\par
the meaning that our arbitrary conventions have given to parts of the\par
original proposition. But if all the signs in it that have arbitrarily\par
determined meanings are turned into variables, we shall still get\par
a class of this kind. This one, however, is not dependent on any\par
convention, but solely on the nature of the pro position. It corresponds\par
to a logical form--a logical prototype.\par
\par
3.316 What values a propositional variable may take is something that is\par
stipulated. The stipulation of values is the variable.\par
\par
3.317 To stipulate values for a propositional variable is to give\par
the propositions whose common characteristic the variable is. The\par
stipulation is a description of those propositions. The stipulation will\par
therefore be concerned only with symbols, not with their meaning. And\par
the only thing essential to the stipulation is that it is merely a\par
description of symbols and states nothing about what is signified. How\par
the description of the propositions is produced is not essential.\par
\par
3.318 Like Frege and Russell I construe a proposition as a function of\par
the expressions contained in it.\par
\par
3.32 A sign is what can be perceived of a symbol.\par
\par
3.321 So one and the same sign (written or spoken, etc.) can be common\par
to two different symbols--in which case they will signify in different\par
ways.\par
\par
3.322 Our use of the same sign to signify two different objects can\par
never indicate a common characteristic of the two, if we use it with two\par
different modes of signification. For the sign, of course, is arbitrary.\par
So we could choose two different signs instead, and then what would be\par
left in common on the signifying side?\par
\par
3.323 In everyday language it very frequently happens that the same\par
word has different modes of signification--and so belongs to different\par
symbols--or that two words that have different modes of signification\par
are employed in propositions in what is superficially the same way. Thus\par
the word &apos;is&apos; figures as the copula, as a sign for identity, and as an\par
expression for existence; &apos;exist&apos; figures as an intransitive verb like\par
&apos;go&apos;, and &apos;identical&apos; as an adjective; we speak of something, but also\par
of something&apos;s happening. (In the proposition, &apos;Green is green&apos;--where\par
the first word is the proper name of a person and the last an\par
adjective--these words do not merely have different meanings: they are\par
different symbols.)\par
\par
3.324 In this way the most fundamental confusions are easily produced\par
(the whole of philosophy is full of them).\par
\par
3.325 In order to avoid such errors we must make use of a sign-language\par
that excludes them by not using the same sign for different symbols and\par
by not using in a superficially similar way signs that have different\par
modes of signification: that is to say, a sign-language that is governed\par
by logical grammar--by logical syntax. (The conceptual notation of Frege\par
and Russell is such a language, though, it is true, it fails to exclude\par
all mistakes.)\par
\par
3.326 In order to recognize a symbol by its sign we must observe how it\par
is used with a sense.\par
\par
3.327 A sign does not determine a logical form unless it is taken\par
together with its logico-syntactical employment.\par
\par
3.328 If a sign is useless, it is meaningless. That is the point of\par
Occam&apos;s maxim. (If everything behaves as if a sign had meaning, then it\par
does have meaning.)\par
\par
3.33 In logical syntax the meaning of a sign should never play a role.\par
It must be possible to establish logical syntax without mentioning\par
the meaning of a sign: only the description of expressions may be\par
presupposed.\par
\par
3.331 From this observation we turn to Russell&apos;s &apos;theory of types&apos;. It\par
can be seen that Russell must be wrong, because he had to mention the\par
meaning of signs when establishing the rules for them.\par
\par
3.332 No proposition can make a statement about itself, because a\par
propositional sign cannot be contained in itself (that is the whole of\par
the &apos;theory of types&apos;).\par
\par
3.333 The reason why a function cannot be its own argument is that the\par
sign for a function already contains the prototype of its argument, and\par
it cannot contain itself. For let us suppose that the function F(fx)\par
could be its own argument: in that case there would be a proposition\par
&apos;F(F(fx))&apos;, in which the outer function F and the inner function F must\par
have different meanings, since the inner one has the form O(f(x)) and\par
the outer one has the form Y(O(fx)). Only the letter &apos;F&apos; is common to\par
the two functions, but the letter by itself signifies nothing. This\par
immediately becomes clear if instead of &apos;F(Fu)&apos; we write &apos;(do): F(Ou).\par
Ou = Fu&apos;. That disposes of Russell&apos;s paradox.\par
\par
3.334 The rules of logical syntax must go without saying, once we know\par
how each individual sign signifies.\par
\par
3.34 A proposition possesses essential and accidental features.\par
Accidental features are those that result from the particular way in\par
which the propositional sign is produced. Essential features are those\par
without which the proposition could not express its sense.\par
\par
3.341 So what is essential in a proposition is what all propositions\par
that can express the same sense have in common. And similarly, in\par
general, what is essential in a symbol is what all symbols that can\par
serve the same purpose have in common.\par
\par
3.3411 So one could say that the real name of an object was what all\par
symbols that signified it had in common. Thus, one by one, all kinds of\par
composition would prove to be unessential to a name.\par
\par
3.342 Although there is something arbitrary in our notations, this much\par
is not arbitrary--that when we have determined one thing arbitrarily,\par
something else is necessarily the case. (This derives from the essence\par
of notation.)\par
\par
3.3421 A particular mode of signifying may be unimportant but it is\par
always important that it is a possible mode of signifying. And that is\par
generally so in philosophy: again and again the individual case turns\par
out to be unimportant, but the possibility of each individual case\par
discloses something about the essence of the world.\par
\par
3.343 Definitions are rules for translating from one language into\par
another. Any correct sign-language must be translatable into any other\par
in accordance with such rules: it is this that they all have in common.\par
\par
3.344 What signifies in a symbol is what is common to all the symbols\par
that the rules of logical syntax allow us to substitute for it.\par
\par
3.3441 For instance, we can express what is common to all notations\par
for truth-functions in the following way: they have in common that, for\par
example, the notation that uses &apos;Pp&apos; (&apos;not p&apos;) and &apos;p C g&apos; (&apos;p or g&apos;)\par
can be substituted for any of them. (This serves to characterize the\par
way in which something general can be disclosed by the possibility of a\par
specific notation.)\par
\par
3.3442 Nor does analysis resolve the sign for a complex in an arbitrary\par
way, so that it would have a different resolution every time that it was\par
incorporated in a different proposition.\par
\par
3.4 A proposition determines a place in logical space. The existence\par
of this logical place is guaranteed by the mere existence of the\par
constituents--by the existence of the proposition with a sense.\par
\par
3.41 The propositional sign with logical coordinates--that is the\par
logical place.\par
\par
3.411 In geometry and logic alike a place is a possibility: something\par
can exist in it.\par
\par
3.42 A proposition can determine only one place in logical space:\par
nevertheless the whole of logical space must already be given by it.\par
(Otherwise negation, logical sum, logical product, etc., would introduce\par
more and more new elements in co-ordination.) (The logical scaffolding\par
surrounding a picture determines logical space. The force of a\par
proposition reaches through the whole of logical space.)\par
\par
3.5 A propositional sign, applied and thought out, is a thought.\par
\par
4. A thought is a proposition with a sense.\par
\par
4.001 The totality of propositions is language.\par
\par
4.022 Man possesses the ability to construct languages capable of\par
expressing every sense, without having any idea how each word has\par
meaning or what its meaning is--just as people speak without knowing how\par
the individual sounds are produced. Everyday language is a part of the\par
human organism and is no less complicated than it. It is not humanly\par
possible to gather immediately from it what the logic of language is.\par
Language disguises thought. So much so, that from the outward form of\par
the clothing it is impossible to infer the form of the thought beneath\par
it, because the outward form of the clothing is not designed to reveal\par
the form of the body, but for entirely different purposes. The tacit\par
conventions on which the understanding of everyday language depends are\par
enormously complicated.\par
\par
4.003 Most of the propositions and questions to be found in\par
philosophical works are not false but nonsensical. Consequently we\par
cannot give any answer to questions of this kind, but can only point\par
out that they are nonsensical. Most of the propositions and questions\par
of philosophers arise from our failure to understand the logic of our\par
language. (They belong to the same class as the question whether the\par
good is more or less identical than the beautiful.) And it is not\par
surprising that the deepest problems are in fact not problems at all.\par
\par
4.0031 All philosophy is a &apos;critique of language&apos; (though not in\par
Mauthner&apos;s sense). It was Russell who performed the service of showing\par
that the apparent logical form of a proposition need not be its real\par
one.\par
\par
4.01 A proposition is a picture of reality. A proposition is a model of\par
reality as we imagine it.\par
\par
4.011 At first sight a proposition--one set out on the printed page, for\par
example--does not seem to be a picture of the reality with which it\par
is concerned. But neither do written notes seem at first sight to be a\par
picture of a piece of music, nor our phonetic notation (the alphabet)\par
to be a picture of our speech. And yet these sign-languages prove to be\par
pictures, even in the ordinary sense, of what they represent.\par
\par
4.012 It is obvious that a proposition of the form &apos;aRb&apos; strikes us as\par
a picture. In this case the sign is obviously a likeness of what is\par
signified.\par
\par
4.013 And if we penetrate to the essence of this pictorial character, we\par
see that it is not impaired by apparent irregularities (such as the\par
use [sharp] of and [flat] in musical notation). For even these\par
irregularities depict what they are intended to express; only they do it\par
in a different way.\par
\par
4.014 A gramophone record, the musical idea, the written notes, and the\par
sound-waves, all stand to one another in the same internal relation\par
of depicting that holds between language and the world. They are all\par
constructed according to a common logical pattern. (Like the two youths\par
in the fairy-tale, their two horses, and their lilies. They are all in a\par
certain sense one.)\par
\par
4.0141 There is a general rule by means of which the musician can obtain\par
the symphony from the score, and which makes it possible to derive the\par
symphony from the groove on the gramophone record, and, using the first\par
rule, to derive the score again. That is what constitutes the inner\par
similarity between these things which seem to be constructed in such\par
entirely different ways. And that rule is the law of projection which\par
projects the symphony into the language of musical notation. It is\par
the rule for translating this language into the language of gramophone\par
records.\par
\par
4.015 The possibility of all imagery, of all our pictorial modes of\par
expression, is contained in the logic of depiction.\par
\par
4.016 In order to understand the essential nature of a proposition, we\par
should consider hieroglyphic script, which depicts the facts that it\par
describes. And alphabetic script developed out of it without losing what\par
was essential to depiction.\par
\par
4.02 We can see this from the fact that we understand the sense of a\par
propositional sign without its having been explained to us.\par
\par
4.021 A proposition is a picture of reality: for if I understand a\par
proposition, I know the situation that it represents. And I understand\par
the proposition without having had its sense explained to me.\par
\par
4.022 A proposition shows its sense. A proposition shows how things\par
stand if it is true. And it says that they do so stand.\par
\par
4.023 A proposition must restrict reality to two alternatives: yes\par
or no. In order to do that, it must describe reality completely.\par
A proposition is a description of a state of affairs. Just as a\par
description of an object describes it by giving its external properties,\par
so a proposition describes reality by its internal properties. A\par
proposition constructs a world with the help of a logical scaffolding,\par
so that one can actually see from the proposition how everything\par
stands logically if it is true. One can draw inferences from a false\par
proposition.\par
\par
4.024 To understand a proposition means to know what is the case if it\par
is true. (One can understand it, therefore, without knowing whether it\par
is true.) It is understood by anyone who understands its constituents.\par
\par
4.025 When translating one language into another, we do not proceed by\par
translating each proposition of the one into a proposition of the other,\par
but merely by translating the constituents of propositions. (And the\par
dictionary translates not only substantives, but also verbs, adjectives,\par
and conjunctions, etc.; and it treats them all in the same way.)\par
\par
4.026 The meanings of simple signs (words) must be explained to us if\par
we are to understand them. With propositions, however, we make ourselves\par
understood.\par
\par
4.027 It belongs to the essence of a proposition that it should be able\par
to communicate a new sense to us.\par
\par
4.03 A proposition must use old expressions to communicate a new\par
sense. A proposition communicates a situation to us, and so it must be\par
essentially connected with the situation. And the connexion is precisely\par
that it is its logical picture. A proposition states something only in\par
so far as it is a picture.\par
\par
4.031 In a proposition a situation is, as it were, constructed by way of\par
experiment. Instead of, &apos;This proposition has such and such a sense, we\par
can simply say, &apos;This proposition represents such and such a situation&apos;.\par
\par
4.0311 One name stands for one thing, another for another thing, and\par
they are combined with one another. In this way the whole group--like a\par
tableau vivant--presents a state of affairs.\par
\par
4.0312 The possibility of propositions is based on the principle that\par
objects have signs as their representatives. My fundamental idea is that\par
the &apos;logical constants&apos; are not representatives; that there can be no\par
representatives of the logic of facts.\par
\par
4.032 It is only in so far as a proposition is logically articulated\par
that it is a picture of a situation. (Even the proposition, &apos;Ambulo&apos;,\par
is composite: for its stem with a different ending yields a different\par
sense, and so does its ending with a different stem.)\par
\par
4.04 In a proposition there must be exactly as many distinguishable\par
parts as in the situation that it represents. The two must possess the\par
same logical (mathematical) multiplicity. (Compare Hertz&apos;s Mechanics on\par
dynamical models.)\par
\par
4.041 This mathematical multiplicity, of course, cannot itself be the\par
subject of depiction. One cannot get away from it when depicting.\par
\par
4.0411. If, for example, we wanted to express what we now write as &apos;(x).\par
fx&apos; by putting an affix in front of &apos;fx&apos;--for instance by writing\par
&apos;Gen. fx&apos;--it would not be adequate: we should not know what was\par
being generalized. If we wanted to signalize it with an affix &apos;g&apos;--for\par
instance by writing &apos;f(xg)&apos;--that would not be adequate either: we\par
should not know the scope of the generality-sign. If we were to try to\par
do it by introducing a mark into the argument-places--for instance by\par
writing &apos;(G,G). F(G,G)&apos; --it would not be adequate: we should not be\par
able to establish the identity of the variables. And so on. All these\par
modes of signifying are inadequate because they lack the necessary\par
mathematical multiplicity.\par
\par
4.0412 For the same reason the idealist&apos;s appeal to &apos;spatial spectacles&apos;\par
is inadequate to explain the seeing of spatial relations, because it\par
cannot explain the multiplicity of these relations.\par
\par
4.05 Reality is compared with propositions.\par
\par
4.06 A proposition can be true or false only in virtue of being a\par
picture of reality.\par
\par
4.061 It must not be overlooked that a proposition has a sense that is\par
independent of the facts: otherwise one can easily suppose that true and\par
false are relations of equal status between signs and what they signify.\par
In that case one could say, for example, that &apos;p&apos; signified in the true\par
way what &apos;Pp&apos; signified in the false way, etc.\par
\par
4.062 Can we not make ourselves understood with false propositions just\par
as we have done up till now with true ones?--So long as it is known that\par
they are meant to be false.--No! For a proposition is true if we use it\par
to say that things stand in a certain way, and they do; and if by &apos;p&apos; we\par
mean Pp and things stand as we mean that they do, then, construed in the\par
new way, &apos;p&apos; is true and not false.\par
\par
4.0621 But it is important that the signs &apos;p&apos; and &apos;Pp&apos; can say the same\par
thing. For it shows that nothing in reality corresponds to the sign\par
&apos;P&apos;. The occurrence of negation in a proposition is not enough to\par
characterize its sense (PPp = p). The propositions &apos;p&apos; and &apos;Pp&apos; have\par
opposite sense, but there corresponds to them one and the same reality.\par
\par
4.063 An analogy to illustrate the concept of truth: imagine a black\par
spot on white paper: you can describe the shape of the spot by saying,\par
for each point on the sheet, whether it is black or white. To the fact\par
that a point is black there corresponds a positive fact, and to the fact\par
that a point is white (not black), a negative fact. If I designate\par
a point on the sheet (a truth-value according to Frege), then this\par
corresponds to the supposition that is put forward for judgement, etc.\par
etc. But in order to be able to say that a point is black or white, I\par
must first know when a point is called black, and when white: in order\par
to be able to say,&apos;&quot;p&quot; is true (or false)&apos;, I must have determined in\par
what circumstances I call &apos;p&apos; true, and in so doing I determine the\par
sense of the proposition. Now the point where the simile breaks down is\par
this: we can indicate a point on the paper even if we do not know\par
what black and white are, but if a proposition has no sense, nothing\par
corresponds to it, since it does not designate a thing (a truth-value)\par
which might have properties called &apos;false&apos; or &apos;true&apos;. The verb of a\par
proposition is not &apos;is true&apos; or &apos;is false&apos;, as Frege thought: rather,\par
that which &apos;is true&apos; must already contain the verb.\par
\par
4.064 Every proposition must already have a sense: it cannot be given a\par
sense by affirmation. Indeed its sense is just what is affirmed. And the\par
same applies to negation, etc.\par
\par
4.0641 One could say that negation must be related to the logical\par
place determined by the negated proposition. The negating proposition\par
determines a logical place different from that of the negated\par
proposition. The negating proposition determines a logical place\par
with the help of the logical place of the negated proposition. For it\par
describes it as lying outside the latter&apos;s logical place. The negated\par
proposition can be negated again, and this in itself shows that what\par
is negated is already a proposition, and not merely something that is\par
preliminary to a proposition.\par
\par
4.1 Propositions represent the existence and non-existence of states of\par
affairs.\par
\par
4.11 The totality of true propositions is the whole of natural science\par
(or the whole corpus of the natural sciences).\par
\par
4.111 Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences. (The word\par
&apos;philosophy&apos; must mean something whose place is above or below the\par
natural sciences, not beside them.)\par
\par
4.112 Philosophy aims at the logical clarification of thoughts.\par
Philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity. A philosophical\par
work consists essentially of elucidations. Philosophy does not result\par
in &apos;philosophical propositions&apos;, but rather in the clarification of\par
propositions. Without philosophy thoughts are, as it were, cloudy\par
and indistinct: its task is to make them clear and to give them sharp\par
boundaries.\par
\par
4.1121 Psychology is no more closely related to philosophy than\par
any other natural science. Theory of knowledge is the philosophy of\par
psychology. Does not my study of sign-language correspond to the study\par
of thought-processes, which philosophers used to consider so essential\par
to the philosophy of logic? Only in most cases they got entangled in\par
unessential psychological investigations, and with my method too there\par
is an analogous risk.\par
\par
4.1122 Darwin&apos;s theory has no more to do with philosophy than any other\par
hypothesis in natural science.\par
\par
4.113 Philosophy sets limits to the much disputed sphere of natural\par
science.\par
\par
4.114 It must set limits to what can be thought; and, in doing so, to\par
what cannot be thought. It must set limits to what cannot be thought by\par
working outwards through what can be thought.\par
\par
4.115 It will signify what cannot be said, by presenting clearly what\par
can be said.\par
\par
4.116 Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly.\par
Everything that can be put into words can be put clearly.\par
\par
4.12 Propositions can represent the whole of reality, but they cannot\par
represent what they must have in common with reality in order to be able\par
to represent it--logical form. In order to be able to represent logical\par
form, we should have to be able to station ourselves with propositions\par
somewhere outside logic, that is to say outside the world.\par
\par
4.121 Propositions cannot represent logical form: it is mirrored in\par
them. What finds its reflection in language, language cannot represent.\par
What expresses itself in language, we cannot express by means of\par
language. Propositions show the logical form of reality. They display\par
it.\par
\par
4.1211 Thus one proposition &apos;fa&apos; shows that the object a occurs in\par
its sense, two propositions &apos;fa&apos; and &apos;ga&apos; show that the same object is\par
mentioned in both of them. If two propositions contradict one another,\par
then their structure shows it; the same is true if one of them follows\par
from the other. And so on.\par
\par
4.1212 What can be shown, cannot be said.\par
\par
4.1213 Now, too, we understand our feeling that once we have a\par
sign-language in which everything is all right, we already have a\par
correct logical point of view.\par
\par
4.122 In a certain sense we can talk about formal properties of objects\par
and states of affairs, or, in the case of facts, about structural\par
properties: and in the same sense about formal relations and structural\par
relations. (Instead of &apos;structural property&apos; I also say &apos;internal\par
property&apos;; instead of &apos;structural relation&apos;, &apos;internal relation&apos;. I\par
introduce these expressions in order to indicate the source of the\par
confusion between internal relations and relations proper (external\par
relations), which is very widespread among philosophers.) It is\par
impossible, however, to assert by means of propositions that such\par
internal properties and relations obtain: rather, this makes itself\par
manifest in the propositions that represent the relevant states of\par
affairs and are concerned with the relevant objects.\par
\par
4.1221 An internal property of a fact can also be bed a feature of that\par
fact (in the sense in which we speak of facial features, for example).\par
\par
4.123 A property is internal if it is unthinkable that its object should\par
not possess it. (This shade of blue and that one stand, eo ipso, in the\par
internal relation of lighter to darker. It is unthinkable that these two\par
objects should not stand in this relation.) (Here the shifting use\par
of the word &apos;object&apos; corresponds to the shifting use of the words\par
&apos;property&apos; and &apos;relation&apos;.)\par
\par
4.124 The existence of an internal property of a possible situation is\par
not expressed by means of a proposition: rather, it expresses itself\par
in the proposition representing the situation, by means of an internal\par
property of that proposition. It would be just as nonsensical to assert\par
that a proposition had a formal property as to deny it.\par
\par
4.1241 It is impossible to distinguish forms from one another by\par
saying that one has this property and another that property: for this\par
presupposes that it makes sense to ascribe either property to either\par
form.\par
\par
4.125 The existence of an internal relation between possible situations\par
expresses itself in language by means of an internal relation between\par
the propositions representing them.\par
\par
4.1251 Here we have the answer to the vexed question &apos;whether all\par
relations are internal or external&apos;.\par
\par
4.1252 I call a series that is ordered by an internal relation a series\par
of forms. The order of the number-series is not governed by an external\par
relation but by an internal relation. The same is true of the series of\par
propositions &apos;aRb&apos;, &apos;(d: c): aRx. xRb&apos;, &apos;(d x,y): aRx. xRy. yRb&apos;, and so\par
forth. (If b stands in one of these relations to a, I call b a successor\par
of a.)\par
\par
4.126 We can now talk about formal concepts, in the same sense that we\par
speak of formal properties. (I introduce this expression in order to\par
exhibit the source of the confusion between formal concepts and concepts\par
proper, which pervades the whole of traditional logic.) When something\par
falls under a formal concept as one of its objects, this cannot be\par
expressed by means of a proposition. Instead it is shown in the very\par
sign for this object. (A name shows that it signifies an object, a sign\par
for a number that it signifies a number, etc.) Formal concepts cannot,\par
in fact, be represented by means of a function, as concepts proper can.\par
For their characteristics, formal properties, are not expressed by\par
means of functions. The expression for a formal property is a feature of\par
certain symbols. So the sign for the characteristics of a formal concept\par
is a distinctive feature of all symbols whose meanings fall under the\par
concept. So the expression for a formal concept is a propositional\par
variable in which this distinctive feature alone is constant.\par
\par
4.127 The propositional variable signifies the formal concept, and its\par
values signify the objects that fall under the concept.\par
\par
4.1271 Every variable is the sign for a formal concept. For every\par
variable represents a constant form that all its values possess, and\par
this can be regarded as a formal property of those values.\par
\par
4.1272 Thus the variable name &apos;x&apos; is the proper sign for the\par
pseudo-concept object. Wherever the word &apos;object&apos; (&apos;thing&apos;, etc.) is\par
correctly used, it is expressed in conceptual notation by a variable\par
name. For example, in the proposition, &apos;There are 2 objects which.. .&apos;,\par
it is expressed by &apos; (dx,y)... &apos;. Wherever it is used in a different\par
way, that is as a proper concept-word, nonsensical pseudo-propositions\par
are the result. So one cannot say, for example, &apos;There are objects&apos;, as\par
one might say, &apos;There are books&apos;. And it is just as impossible to\par
say, &apos;There are 100 objects&apos;, or, &apos;There are!0 objects&apos;. And it is\par
nonsensical to speak of the total number of objects. The same applies to\par
the words &apos;complex&apos;, &apos;fact&apos;, &apos;function&apos;, &apos;number&apos;, etc. They all\par
signify formal concepts, and are represented in conceptual notation by\par
variables, not by functions or classes (as Frege and Russell believed).\par
&apos;1 is a number&apos;, &apos;There is only one zero&apos;, and all similar expressions\par
are nonsensical. (It is just as nonsensical to say, &apos;There is only one\par
1&apos;, as it would be to say, &apos;2 + 2 at 3 o&apos;clock equals 4&apos;.)\par
\par
4.12721 A formal concept is given immediately any object falling under\par
it is given. It is not possible, therefore, to introduce as primitive\par
ideas objects belonging to a formal concept and the formal concept\par
itself. So it is impossible, for example, to introduce as primitive\par
ideas both the concept of a function and specific functions, as Russell\par
does; or the concept of a number and particular numbers.\par
\par
4.1273 If we want to express in conceptual notation the general\par
proposition, &apos;b is a successor of a&apos;, then we require an expression for\par
the general term of the series of forms &apos;aRb&apos;, &apos;(d: c): aRx. xRb&apos;, &apos;(d\par
x,y) : aRx. xRy. yRb&apos;,..., In order to express the general term of a\par
series of forms, we must use a variable, because the concept &apos;term\par
of that series of forms&apos; is a formal concept. (This is what Frege and\par
Russell overlooked: consequently the way in which they want to express\par
general propositions like the one above is incorrect; it contains a\par
vicious circle.) We can determine the general term of a series of forms\par
by giving its first term and the general form of the operation that\par
produces the next term out of the proposition that precedes it.\par
\par
4.1274 To ask whether a formal concept exists is nonsensical. For no\par
proposition can be the answer to such a question. (So, for example,\par
the question, &apos;Are there unanalysable subject-predicate propositions?&apos;\par
cannot be asked.)\par
\par
4.128 Logical forms are without number. Hence there are no pre-eminent\par
numbers in logic, and hence there is no possibility of philosophical\par
monism or dualism, etc.\par
\par
4.2 The sense of a proposition is its agreement and disagreement with\par
possibilities of existence and non-existence of states of affairs. 4.21\par
The simplest kind of proposition, an elementary proposition, asserts the\par
existence of a state of affairs.\par
\par
4.211 It is a sign of a proposition&apos;s being elementary that there can be\par
no elementary proposition contradicting it.\par
\par
4.22 An elementary proposition consists of names. It is a nexus, a\par
concatenation, of names.\par
\par
4.221 It is obvious that the analysis of propositions must bring us to\par
elementary propositions which consist of names in immediate combination.\par
This raises the question how such combination into propositions comes\par
about.\par
\par
4.2211 Even if the world is infinitely complex, so that every fact\par
consists of infinitely many states of affairs and every state of affairs\par
is composed of infinitely many objects, there would still have to be\par
objects and states of affairs.\par
\par
4.23 It is only in the nexus of an elementary proposition that a name\par
occurs in a proposition.\par
\par
4.24 Names are the simple symbols: I indicate them by single letters\par
(&apos;x&apos;, &apos;y&apos;, &apos;z&apos;). I write elementary propositions as functions of names,\par
so that they have the form &apos;fx&apos;, &apos;O (x,y)&apos;, etc. Or I indicate them by\par
the letters &apos;p&apos;, &apos;q&apos;, &apos;r&apos;.\par
\par
4.241 When I use two signs with one and the same meaning, I express this\par
by putting the sign &apos;=&apos; between them. So &apos;a = b&apos; means that the sign &apos;b&apos;\par
can be substituted for the sign &apos;a&apos;. (If I use an equation to introduce\par
a new sign &apos;b&apos;, laying down that it shall serve as a substitute for\par
a sign a that is already known, then, like Russell, I write the\par
equation--definition--in the form &apos;a = b Def.&apos; A definition is a rule\par
dealing with signs.)\par
\par
4.242 Expressions of the form &apos;a = b&apos; are, therefore, mere\par
representational devices. They state nothing about the meaning of the\par
signs &apos;a&apos; and &apos;b&apos;.\par
\par
4.243 Can we understand two names without knowing whether they signify\par
the same thing or two different things?--Can we understand a proposition\par
in which two names occur without knowing whether their meaning is the\par
same or different? Suppose I know the meaning of an English word and of\par
a German word that means the same: then it is impossible for me to be\par
unaware that they do mean the same; I must be capable of translating\par
each into the other. Expressions like &apos;a = a&apos;, and those derived from\par
them, are neither elementary propositions nor is there any other way in\par
which they have sense. (This will become evident later.)\par
\par
4.25 If an elementary proposition is true, the state of affairs exists:\par
if an elementary proposition is false, the state of affairs does not\par
exist.\par
\par
4.26 If all true elementary propositions are given, the result is a\par
complete description of the world. The world is completely described by\par
giving all elementary propositions, and adding which of them are true\par
and which false. For n states of affairs, there are possibilities of\par
existence and non-existence. Of these states of affairs any combination\par
can exist and the remainder not exist.\par
\par
4.28 There correspond to these combinations the same number of\par
possibilities of truth--and falsity--for n elementary propositions.\par
\par
4.3 Truth-possibilities of elementary propositions mean Possibilities of\par
existence and non-existence of states of affairs.\par
\par
4.31 We can represent truth-possibilities by schemata of the following\par
kind (&apos;T&apos; means &apos;true&apos;, &apos;F&apos; means &apos;false&apos;; the rows of &apos;T&apos;s&apos; and\par
&apos;F&apos;s&apos; under the row of elementary propositions symbolize their\par
truth-possibilities in a way that can easily be understood):\par
\par
4.4 A proposition is an expression of agreement and disagreement with\par
truth-possibilities of elementary propositions.\par
\par
4.41 Truth-possibilities of elementary propositions are the conditions\par
of the truth and falsity of propositions.\par
\par
4.411 It immediately strikes one as probable that the introduction of\par
elementary propositions provides the basis for understanding all other\par
kinds of proposition. Indeed the understanding of general propositions\par
palpably depends on the understanding of elementary propositions.\par
\par
4.42 For n elementary propositions there are ways in which a proposition\par
can agree and disagree with their truth possibilities.\par
\par
4.43 We can express agreement with truth-possibilities by correlating\par
the mark &apos;T&apos; (true) with them in the schema. The absence of this mark\par
means disagreement.\par
\par
4.431 The expression of agreement and disagreement with the truth\par
possibilities of elementary propositions expresses the truth-conditions\par
of a proposition. A proposition is the expression of its\par
truth-conditions. (Thus Frege was quite right to use them as a starting\par
point when he explained the signs of his conceptual notation. But the\par
explanation of the concept of truth that Frege gives is mistaken: if\par
&apos;the true&apos; and &apos;the false&apos; were really objects, and were the arguments\par
in Pp etc., then Frege&apos;s method of determining the sense of &apos;Pp&apos; would\par
leave it absolutely undetermined.)\par
\par
4.44 The sign that results from correlating the mark &apos;I&apos; with\par
truth-possibilities is a propositional sign.\par
\par
4.441 It is clear that a complex of the signs &apos;F&apos; and &apos;T&apos; has no object\par
(or complex of objects) corresponding to it, just as there is\par
none corresponding to the horizontal and vertical lines or to the\par
brackets.--There are no &apos;logical objects&apos;. Of course the same applies to\par
all signs that express what the schemata of &apos;T&apos;s&apos; and &apos;F&apos;s&apos; express.\par
\par
4.442 For example, the following is a propositional sign: (Frege&apos;s\par
&apos;judgement stroke&apos; &apos;|-&apos; is logically quite meaningless: in the works\par
of Frege (and Russell) it simply indicates that these authors hold the\par
propositions marked with this sign to be true. Thus &apos;|-&apos; is no more a\par
component part of a proposition than is, for instance, the proposition&apos;s\par
number. It is quite impossible for a proposition to state that it itself\par
is true.) If the order or the truth-possibilities in a scheme is fixed\par
once and for all by a combinatory rule, then the last column by itself\par
will be an expression of the truth-conditions. If we now write this\par
column as a row, the propositional sign will become &apos;(TT-T) (p,q)&apos; or\par
more explicitly &apos;(TTFT) (p,q)&apos; (The number of places in the left-hand\par
pair of brackets is determined by the number of terms in the right-hand\par
pair.)\par
\par
4.45 For n elementary propositions there are Ln possible groups of\par
truth-conditions. The groups of truth-conditions that are obtainable\par
from the truth-possibilities of a given number of elementary\par
propositions can be arranged in a series.\par
\par
4.46 Among the possible groups of truth-conditions there are two\par
extreme cases. In one of these cases the proposition is true for all\par
the truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions. We say that the\par
truth-conditions are tautological. In the second case the proposition\par
is false for all the truth-possibilities: the truth-conditions are\par
contradictory. In the first case we call the proposition a tautology; in\par
the second, a contradiction.\par
\par
4.461 Propositions show what they say; tautologies and contradictions\par
show that they say nothing. A tautology has no truth-conditions, since\par
it is unconditionally true: and a contradiction is true on no condition.\par
Tautologies and contradictions lack sense. (Like a point from which two\par
arrows go out in opposite directions to one another.) (For example, I\par
know nothing about the weather when I know that it is either raining or\par
not raining.)\par
\par
4.46211 Tautologies and contradictions are not, however, nonsensical.\par
They are part of the symbolism, much as &apos;0&apos; is part of the symbolism of\par
arithmetic.\par
\par
4.462 Tautologies and contradictions are not pictures of reality. They\par
do not represent any possible situations. For the former admit all\par
possible situations, and latter none. In a tautology the conditions of\par
agreement with the world--the representational relations--cancel one\par
another, so that it does not stand in any representational relation to\par
reality.\par
\par
4.463 The truth-conditions of a proposition determine the range that it\par
leaves open to the facts. (A proposition, a picture, or a model is,\par
in the negative sense, like a solid body that restricts the freedom of\par
movement of others, and in the positive sense, like a space bounded by\par
solid substance in which there is room for a body.) A tautology leaves\par
open to reality the whole--the infinite whole--of logical space: a\par
contradiction fills the whole of logical space leaving no point of it\par
for reality. Thus neither of them can determine reality in any way.\par
\par
4.464 A tautology&apos;s truth is certain, a proposition&apos;s possible, a\par
contradiction&apos;s impossible. (Certain, possible, impossible: here we\par
have the first indication of the scale that we need in the theory of\par
probability.)\par
\par
4.465 The logical product of a tautology and a proposition says the same\par
thing as the proposition. This product, therefore, is identical with the\par
proposition. For it is impossible to alter what is essential to a symbol\par
without altering its sense.\par
\par
4.466 What corresponds to a determinate logical combination of signs is\par
a determinate logical combination of their meanings. It is only to the\par
uncombined signs that absolutely any combination corresponds. In\par
other words, propositions that are true for every situation cannot be\par
combinations of signs at all, since, if they were, only determinate\par
combinations of objects could correspond to them. (And what is not a\par
logical combination has no combination of objects corresponding to\par
it.) Tautology and contradiction are the limiting cases--indeed the\par
disintegration--of the combination of signs.\par
\par
4.4661 Admittedly the signs are still combined with one another even in\par
tautologies and contradictions--i.e. they stand in certain relations to\par
one another: but these relations have no meaning, they are not essential\par
to the symbol.\par
\par
4.5 It now seems possible to give the most general propositional form:\par
that is, to give a description of the propositions of any sign-language\par
whatsoever in such a way that every possible sense can be expressed by\par
a symbol satisfying the description, and every symbol satisfying the\par
description can express a sense, provided that the meanings of the names\par
are suitably chosen. It is clear that only what is essential to the\par
most general propositional form may be included in its description--for\par
otherwise it would not be the most general form. The existence of a\par
general propositional form is proved by the fact that there cannot be a\par
proposition whose form could not have been foreseen (i.e. constructed).\par
The general form of a proposition is: This is how things stand.\par
\par
4.51 Suppose that I am given all elementary propositions: then I can\par
simply ask what propositions I can construct out of them. And there I\par
have all propositions, and that fixes their limits.\par
\par
4.52 Propositions comprise all that follows from the totality of all\par
elementary propositions (and, of course, from its being the totality\par
of them all ). (Thus, in a certain sense, it could be said that all\par
propositions were generalizations of elementary propositions.)\par
\par
4.53 The general propositional form is a variable.\par
\par
5. A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions.\par
\par
(An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)\par
\par
5.01 Elementary propositions are the truth-arguments of propositions.\par
\par
5.02 The arguments of functions are readily confused with the affixes of\par
names. For both arguments and affixes enable me to recognize the meaning\par
of the signs containing them. For example, when Russell writes &apos;+c&apos;,\par
the &apos;c&apos; is an affix which indicates that the sign as a whole is the\par
addition-sign for cardinal numbers. But the use of this sign is the\par
result of arbitrary convention and it would be quite possible to choose\par
a simple sign instead of &apos;+c&apos;; in &apos;Pp&apos; however, &apos;p&apos; is not an affix but\par
an argument: the sense of &apos;Pp&apos; cannot be understood unless the sense of\par
&apos;p&apos; has been understood already. (In the name Julius Caesar &apos;Julius&apos;\par
is an affix. An affix is always part of a description of the object to\par
whose name we attach it: e.g. the Caesar of the Julian gens.) If I\par
am not mistaken, Frege&apos;s theory about the meaning of propositions and\par
functions is based on the confusion between an argument and an affix.\par
Frege regarded the propositions of logic as names, and their arguments\par
as the affixes of those names.\par
\par
5.1 Truth-functions can be arranged in series. That is the foundation of\par
the theory of probability.\par
\par
5.101 The truth-functions of a given number of elementary propositions\par
can always be set out in a schema of the following kind: (TTTT) (p, q)\par
Tautology (If p then p, and if q then q.) (p z p. q z q) (FTTT) (p, q)\par
In words: Not both p and q. (P(p. q)) (TFTT) (p, q) &quot;: If q then p. (q\par
z p) (TTFT) (p, q) &quot;: If p then q. (p z q) (TTTF) (p, q) &quot;: p or q. (p C\par
q) (FFTT) (p, q) &quot;: Not g. (Pq) (FTFT) (p, q) &quot;: Not p. (Pp) (FTTF) (p,\par
q) &quot; : p or q, but not both. (p. Pq: C: q. Pp) (TFFT) (p, q) &quot;: If p\par
then p, and if q then p. (p + q) (TFTF) (p, q) &quot;: p (TTFF) (p, q) &quot;: q\par
(FFFT) (p, q) &quot;: Neither p nor q. (Pp. Pq or p | q) (FFTF) (p, q) &quot;: p\par
and not q. (p. Pq) (FTFF) (p, q) &quot;: q and not p. (q. Pp) (TFFF) (p,q) &quot;:\par
q and p. (q. p) (FFFF) (p, q) Contradiction (p and not p, and q and not\par
q.) (p. Pp. q. Pq) I will give the name truth-grounds of a proposition\par
to those truth-possibilities of its truth-arguments that make it true.\par
\par
5.11 If all the truth-grounds that are common to a number of\par
propositions are at the same time truth-grounds of a certain\par
proposition, then we say that the truth of that proposition follows from\par
the truth of the others.\par
\par
5.12 In particular, the truth of a proposition &apos;p&apos; follows from the\par
truth of another proposition &apos;q&apos; is all the truth-grounds of the latter\par
are truth-grounds of the former.\par
\par
5.121 The truth-grounds of the one are contained in those of the other:\par
p follows from q.\par
\par
5.122 If p follows from q, the sense of &apos;p&apos; is contained in the sense of\par
&apos;q&apos;.\par
\par
5.123 If a god creates a world in which certain propositions are\par
true, then by that very act he also creates a world in which all the\par
propositions that follow from them come true. And similarly he could not\par
create a world in which the proposition &apos;p&apos; was true without creating\par
all its objects.\par
\par
5.124 A proposition affirms every proposition that follows from it.\par
\par
5.1241 &apos;p. q&apos; is one of the propositions that affirm &apos;p&apos; and at the\par
same time one of the propositions that affirm &apos;q&apos;. Two propositions are\par
opposed to one another if there is no proposition with a sense, that\par
affirms them both. Every proposition that contradicts another negate it.\par
\par
5.13 When the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of others,\par
we can see this from the structure of the proposition.\par
\par
5.131 If the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of\par
others, this finds expression in relations in which the forms of the\par
propositions stand to one another: nor is it necessary for us to set up\par
these relations between them, by combining them with one another in a\par
single proposition; on the contrary, the relations are internal,\par
and their existence is an immediate result of the existence of the\par
propositions.\par
\par
5.1311 When we infer q from p C q and Pp, the relation between the\par
propositional forms of &apos;p C q&apos; and &apos;Pp&apos; is masked, in this case, by our\par
mode of signifying. But if instead of &apos;p C q&apos; we write, for example,\par
&apos;p|q. |. p|q&apos;, and instead of &apos;Pp&apos;, &apos;p|p&apos; (p|q = neither p nor q), then\par
the inner connexion becomes obvious. (The possibility of inference from\par
(x). fx to fa shows that the symbol (x). fx itself has generality in\par
it.)\par
\par
5.132 If p follows from q, I can make an inference from q to p, deduce\par
p from q. The nature of the inference can be gathered only from the two\par
propositions. They themselves are the only possible justification of\par
the inference. &apos;Laws of inference&apos;, which are supposed to justify\par
inferences, as in the works of Frege and Russell, have no sense, and\par
would be superfluous.\par
\par
5.133 All deductions are made a priori.\par
\par
5.134 One elementary proposition cannot be deduced form another.\par
\par
5.135 There is no possible way of making an inference form the existence\par
of one situation to the existence of another, entirely different\par
situation.\par
\par
5.136 There is no causal nexus to justify such an inference.\par
\par
5.1361 We cannot infer the events of the future from those of the\par
present. Belief in the causal nexus is superstition.\par
\par
5.1362 The freedom of the will consists in the impossibility of knowing\par
actions that still lie in the future. We could know them only if\par
causality were an inner necessity like that of logical inference.--The\par
connexion between knowledge and what is known is that of logical\par
necessity. (&apos;A knows that p is the case&apos;, has no sense if p is a\par
tautology.)\par
\par
5.1363 If the truth of a proposition does not follow from the fact that\par
it is self-evident to us, then its self-evidence in no way justifies our\par
belief in its truth.\par
\par
5.14 If one proposition follows from another, then the latter says more\par
than the former, and the former less than the latter.\par
\par
5.141 If p follows from q and q from p, then they are one and same\par
proposition.\par
\par
5.142 A tautology follows from all propositions: it says nothing.\par
\par
5.143 Contradiction is that common factor of propositions which no\par
proposition has in common with another. Tautology is the common factor\par
of all propositions that have nothing in common with one another.\par
Contradiction, one might say, vanishes outside all propositions:\par
tautology vanishes inside them. Contradiction is the outer limit of\par
propositions: tautology is the unsubstantial point at their centre.\par
\par
5.15 If Tr is the number of the truth-grounds of a proposition &apos;r&apos;, and\par
if Trs is the number of the truth-grounds of a proposition &apos;s&apos; that are\par
at the same time truth-grounds of &apos;r&apos;, then we call the ratio Trs:\par
Tr the degree of probability that the proposition &apos;r&apos; gives to the\par
proposition &apos;s&apos;. 5.151 In a schema like the one above in\par
\par
5.101, let Tr be the number of &apos;T&apos;s&apos; in the proposition r, and let Trs,\par
be the number of &apos;T&apos;s&apos; in the proposition s that stand in columns in\par
which the proposition r has &apos;T&apos;s&apos;. Then the proposition r gives to the\par
proposition s the probability Trs: Tr.\par
\par
5.1511 There is no special object peculiar to probability propositions.\par
\par
5.152 When propositions have no truth-arguments in common with one\par
another, we call them independent of one another. Two elementary\par
propositions give one another the probability 1/2. If p follows from q,\par
then the proposition &apos;q&apos; gives to the proposition &apos;p&apos; the probability\par
1. The certainty of logical inference is a limiting case of probability.\par
(Application of this to tautology and contradiction.)\par
\par
5.153 In itself, a proposition is neither probable nor improbable.\par
Either an event occurs or it does not: there is no middle way.\par
\par
5.154 Suppose that an urn contains black and white balls in equal\par
numbers (and none of any other kind). I draw one ball after another,\par
putting them back into the urn. By this experiment I can establish that\par
the number of black balls drawn and the number of white balls drawn\par
approximate to one another as the draw continues. So this is not a\par
mathematical truth. Now, if I say, &apos;The probability of my drawing a\par
white ball is equal to the probability of my drawing a black one&apos;, this\par
means that all the circumstances that I know of (including the laws of\par
nature assumed as hypotheses) give no more probability to the occurrence\par
of the one event than to that of the other. That is to say, they give\par
each the probability 1/2 as can easily be gathered from the above\par
definitions. What I confirm by the experiment is that the occurrence of\par
the two events is independent of the circumstances of which I have no\par
more detailed knowledge.\par
\par
5.155 The minimal unit for a probability proposition is this: The\par
circumstances--of which I have no further knowledge--give such and such\par
a degree of probability to the occurrence of a particular event.\par
\par
5.156 It is in this way that probability is a generalization. It\par
involves a general description of a propositional form. We use\par
probability only in default of certainty--if our knowledge of a fact\par
is not indeed complete, but we do know something about its form. (A\par
proposition may well be an incomplete picture of a certain situation,\par
but it is always a complete picture of something.) A probability\par
proposition is a sort of excerpt from other propositions.\par
\par
5.2 The structures of propositions stand in internal relations to one\par
another.\par
\par
5.21 In order to give prominence to these internal relations we can\par
adopt the following mode of expression: we can represent a proposition\par
as the result of an operation that produces it out of other propositions\par
(which are the bases of the operation).\par
\par
5.22 An operation is the expression of a relation between the structures\par
of its result and of its bases.\par
\par
5.23 The operation is what has to be done to the one proposition in\par
order to make the other out of it.\par
\par
5.231 And that will, of course, depend on their formal properties, on\par
the internal similarity of their forms.\par
\par
5.232 The internal relation by which a series is ordered is equivalent\par
to the operation that produces one term from another.\par
\par
5.233 Operations cannot make their appearance before the point at which\par
one proposition is generated out of another in a logically meaningful\par
way; i.e. the point at which the logical construction of propositions\par
begins.\par
\par
5.234 Truth-functions of elementary propositions are results of\par
operations with elementary propositions as bases. (These operations I\par
call truth-operations.)\par
\par
5.2341 The sense of a truth-function of p is a function of the sense\par
of p. Negation, logical addition, logical multiplication, etc. etc. are\par
operations. (Negation reverses the sense of a proposition.)\par
\par
5.24 An operation manifests itself in a variable; it shows how we can\par
get from one form of proposition to another. It gives expression to the\par
difference between the forms. (And what the bases of an operation and\par
its result have in common is just the bases themselves.)\par
\par
5.241 An operation is not the mark of a form, but only of a difference\par
between forms.\par
\par
5.242 The operation that produces &apos;q&apos; from &apos;p&apos; also produces &apos;r&apos; from\par
&apos;q&apos;, and so on. There is only one way of expressing this: &apos;p&apos;, &apos;q&apos;,\par
&apos;r&apos;, etc. have to be variables that give expression in a general way to\par
certain formal relations.\par
\par
5.25 The occurrence of an operation does not characterize the sense of\par
a proposition. Indeed, no statement is made by an operation, but only by\par
its result, and this depends on the bases of the operation. (Operations\par
and functions must not be confused with each other.)\par
\par
5.251 A function cannot be its own argument, whereas an operation can\par
take one of its own results as its base.\par
\par
5.252 It is only in this way that the step from one term of a series\par
of forms to another is possible (from one type to another in the\par
hierarchies of Russell and Whitehead). (Russell and Whitehead did not\par
admit the possibility of such steps, but repeatedly availed themselves\par
of it.)\par
\par
5.2521 If an operation is applied repeatedly to its own results, I speak\par
of successive applications of it. (&apos;O&apos;O&apos;O&apos;a&apos; is the result of three\par
successive applications of the operation &apos;O&apos;E&apos; to &apos;a&apos;.) In a similar\par
sense I speak of successive applications of more than one operation to a\par
number of propositions.\par
\par
5.2522 Accordingly I use the sign &apos;[a, x, O&apos;x]&apos; for the general term of\par
the series of forms a, O&apos;a, O&apos;O&apos;a,.... This bracketed expression is a\par
variable: the first term of the bracketed expression is the beginning\par
of the series of forms, the second is the form of a term x arbitrarily\par
selected from the series, and the third is the form of the term that\par
immediately follows x in the series.\par
\par
5.2523 The concept of successive applications of an operation is\par
equivalent to the concept &apos;and so on&apos;.\par
\par
5.253 One operation can counteract the effect of another. Operations can\par
cancel one another.\par
\par
5.254 An operation can vanish (e.g. negation in &apos;PPp&apos;: PPp = p).\par
\par
5.3 All propositions are results of truth-operations on elementary\par
propositions. A truth-operation is the way in which a truth-function\par
is produced out of elementary propositions. It is of the essence\par
of truth-operations that, just as elementary propositions yield a\par
truth-function of themselves, so too in the same way truth-functions\par
yield a further truth-function. When a truth-operation is applied to\par
truth-functions of elementary propositions, it always generates another\par
truth-function of elementary propositions, another proposition. When\par
a truth-operation is applied to the results of truth-operations\par
on elementary propositions, there is always a single operation on\par
elementary propositions that has the same result. Every proposition is\par
the result of truth-operations on elementary propositions.\par
\par
5.31 The schemata in 4.31 have a meaning even when &apos;p&apos;, &apos;q&apos;, &apos;r&apos;,\par
etc. are not elementary propositions. And it is easy to see that\par
the propositional sign in 4.442 expresses a single truth-function of\par
elementary propositions even when &apos;p&apos; and &apos;q&apos; are truth-functions of\par
elementary propositions.\par
\par
5.32 All truth-functions are results of successive applications to\par
elementary propositions of a finite number of truth-operations.\par
\par
5.4 At this point it becomes manifest that there are no &apos;logical\par
objects&apos; or &apos;logical constants&apos; (in Frege&apos;s and Russell&apos;s sense).\par
\par
5.41 The reason is that the results of truth-operations on\par
truth-functions are always identical whenever they are one and the same\par
truth-function of elementary propositions.\par
\par
5.42 It is self-evident that C, z, etc. are not relations in the sense\par
in which right and left etc. are relations. The interdefinability of\par
Frege&apos;s and Russell&apos;s &apos;primitive signs&apos; of logic is enough to show that\par
they are not primitive signs, still less signs for relations. And it is\par
obvious that the &apos;z&apos; defined by means of &apos;P&apos; and &apos;C&apos; is identical with\par
the one that figures with &apos;P&apos; in the definition of &apos;C&apos;; and that the\par
second &apos;C&apos; is identical with the first one; and so on.\par
\par
5.43 Even at first sight it seems scarcely credible that there should\par
follow from one fact p infinitely many others, namely PPp, PPPPp, etc.\par
And it is no less remarkable that the infinite number of propositions of\par
logic (mathematics) follow from half a dozen &apos;primitive propositions&apos;.\par
But in fact all the propositions of logic say the same thing, to wit\par
nothing.\par
\par
5.44 Truth-functions are not material functions. For example, an\par
affirmation can be produced by double negation: in such a case does it\par
follow that in some sense negation is contained in affirmation? Does\par
&apos;PPp&apos; negate Pp, or does it affirm p--or both? The proposition &apos;PPp&apos; is\par
not about negation, as if negation were an object: on the other hand,\par
the possibility of negation is already written into affirmation. And\par
if there were an object called &apos;P&apos;, it would follow that &apos;PPp&apos; said\par
something different from what &apos;p&apos; said, just because the one proposition\par
would then be about P and the other would not.\par
\par
5.441 This vanishing of the apparent logical constants also occurs in\par
the case of &apos;P(dx). Pfx&apos;, which says the same as &apos;(x). fx&apos;, and in the\par
case of &apos;(dx). fx. x = a&apos;, which says the same as &apos;fa&apos;.\par
\par
5.442 If we are given a proposition, then with it we are also given the\par
results of all truth-operations that have it as their base.\par
\par
5.45 If there are primitive logical signs, then any logic that fails\par
to show clearly how they are placed relatively to one another and to\par
justify their existence will be incorrect. The construction of logic out\par
of its primitive signs must be made clear.\par
\par
5.451 If logic has primitive ideas, they must be independent of one\par
another. If a primitive idea has been introduced, it must have been\par
introduced in all the combinations in which it ever occurs. It\par
cannot, therefore, be introduced first for one combination and\par
later reintroduced for another. For example, once negation has been\par
introduced, we must understand it both in propositions of the form\par
&apos;Pp&apos; and in propositions like &apos;P(p C q)&apos;, &apos;(dx). Pfx&apos;, etc. We must not\par
introduce it first for the one class of cases and then for the other,\par
since it would then be left in doubt whether its meaning were the same\par
in both cases, and no reason would have been given for combining the\par
signs in the same way in both cases. (In short, Frege&apos;s remarks about\par
introducing signs by means of definitions (in The Fundamental Laws\par
of Arithmetic ) also apply, mutatis mutandis, to the introduction of\par
primitive signs.)\par
\par
5.452 The introduction of any new device into the symbolism of logic\par
is necessarily a momentous event. In logic a new device should not\par
be introduced in brackets or in a footnote with what one might call\par
a completely innocent air. (Thus in Russell and Whitehead&apos;s Principia\par
Mathematica there occur definitions and primitive propositions expressed\par
in words. Why this sudden appearance of words? It would require a\par
justification, but none is given, or could be given, since the procedure\par
is in fact illicit.) But if the introduction of a new device has proved\par
necessary at a certain point, we must immediately ask ourselves, &apos;At\par
what points is the employment of this device now unavoidable?&apos; and its\par
place in logic must be made clear.\par
\par
5.453 All numbers in logic stand in need of justification. Or rather,\par
it must become evident that there are no numbers in logic. There are no\par
pre-eminent numbers.\par
\par
5.454 In logic there is no co-ordinate status, and there can be no\par
classification. In logic there can be no distinction between the general\par
and the specific.\par
\par
5.4541 The solutions of the problems of logic must be simple, since they\par
set the standard of simplicity. Men have always had a presentiment\par
that there must be a realm in which the answers to questions are\par
symmetrically combined--a priori--to form a self-contained system. A\par
realm subject to the law: Simplex sigillum veri.\par
\par
5.46 If we introduced logical signs properly, then we should also have\par
introduced at the same time the sense of all combinations of them; i.e.\par
not only &apos;p C q&apos; but &apos;P(p C q)&apos; as well, etc. etc. We should also have\par
introduced at the same time the effect of all possible combinations of\par
brackets. And thus it would have been made clear that the real general\par
primitive signs are not &apos;p C q&apos;, &apos;(dx). fx&apos;, etc. but the most general\par
form of their combinations.\par
\par
5.461 Though it seems unimportant, it is in fact significant that the\par
pseudo-relations of logic, such as C and z, need brackets--unlike real\par
relations. Indeed, the use of brackets with these apparently primitive\par
signs is itself an indication that they are not primitive signs. And\par
surely no one is going to believe brackets have an independent meaning.\par
5.4611 Signs for logical operations are punctuation-marks.\par
\par
5.47 It is clear that whatever we can say in advance about the form\par
of all propositions, we must be able to say all at once. An elementary\par
proposition really contains all logical operations in itself. For\par
&apos;fa&apos; says the same thing as &apos;(dx). fx. x = a&apos; Wherever there is\par
compositeness, argument and function are present, and where these are\par
present, we already have all the logical constants. One could say that\par
the sole logical constant was what all propositions, by their very\par
nature, had in common with one another. But that is the general\par
propositional form.\par
\par
5.471 The general propositional form is the essence of a proposition.\par
\par
5.4711 To give the essence of a proposition means to give the essence of\par
all description, and thus the essence of the world.\par
\par
5.472 The description of the most general propositional form is the\par
description of the one and only general primitive sign in logic.\par
\par
5.473 Logic must look after itself. If a sign is possible, then it\par
is also capable of signifying. Whatever is possible in logic is also\par
permitted. (The reason why &apos;Socrates is identical&apos; means nothing is that\par
there is no property called &apos;identical&apos;. The proposition is nonsensical\par
because we have failed to make an arbitrary determination, and not\par
because the symbol, in itself, would be illegitimate.) In a certain\par
sense, we cannot make mistakes in logic.\par
\par
5.4731 Self-evidence, which Russell talked about so much, can become\par
dispensable in logic, only because language itself prevents every\par
logical mistake.--What makes logic a priori is the impossibility of\par
illogical thought.\par
\par
5.4732 We cannot give a sign the wrong sense.\par
\par
5,47321 Occam&apos;s maxim is, of course, not an arbitrary rule, nor one that\par
is justified by its success in practice: its point is that unnecessary\par
units in a sign-language mean nothing. Signs that serve one purpose\par
are logically equivalent, and signs that serve none are logically\par
meaningless.\par
\par
5.4733 Frege says that any legitimately constructed proposition must\par
have a sense. And I say that any possible proposition is legitimately\par
constructed, and, if it has no sense, that can only be because we have\par
failed to give a meaning to some of its constituents. (Even if we think\par
that we have done so.) Thus the reason why &apos;Socrates is identical&apos; says\par
nothing is that we have not given any adjectival meaning to the word\par
&apos;identical&apos;. For when it appears as a sign for identity, it symbolizes\par
in an entirely different way--the signifying relation is a different\par
one--therefore the symbols also are entirely different in the two cases:\par
the two symbols have only the sign in common, and that is an accident.\par
\par
5.474 The number of fundamental operations that are necessary depends\par
solely on our notation.\par
\par
5.475 All that is required is that we should construct a system of signs\par
with a particular number of dimensions--with a particular mathematical\par
multiplicity.\par
\par
5.476 It is clear that this is not a question of a number of primitive\par
ideas that have to be signified, but rather of the expression of a rule.\par
\par
5.5 Every truth-function is a result of successive applications to\par
elementary propositions of the operation &apos;(-----T)(E,....)&apos;. This\par
operation negates all the propositions in the right-hand pair of\par
brackets, and I call it the negation of those propositions.\par
\par
5.501 When a bracketed expression has propositions as its terms--and the\par
order of the terms inside the brackets is indifferent--then I indicate\par
it by a sign of the form &apos;(E)&apos;. &apos;(E)&apos; is a variable whose values\par
are terms of the bracketed expression and the bar over the variable\par
indicates that it is the representative of all its values in the\par
brackets. (E.g. if E has the three values P,Q, R, then (E) = (P, Q, R).\par
) What the values of the variable are is something that is stipulated.\par
The stipulation is a description of the propositions that have the\par
variable as their representative. How the description of the terms\par
of the bracketed expression is produced is not essential. We can\par
distinguish three kinds of description: 1. Direct enumeration, in which\par
case we can simply substitute for the variable the constants that are\par
its values; 2. Giving a function fx whose values for all values of x are\par
the propositions to be described; 3. Giving a formal law that governs\par
the construction of the propositions, in which case the bracketed\par
expression has as its members all the terms of a series of forms.\par
\par
5.502 So instead of &apos;(-----T)(E,....)&apos;, I write &apos;N(E)&apos;. N(E) is the\par
negation of all the values of the propositional variable E.\par
\par
5.503 It is obvious that we can easily express how propositions may be\par
constructed with this operation, and how they may not be constructed\par
with it; so it must be possible to find an exact expression for this.\par
\par
5.51 If E has only one value, then N(E) = Pp (not p); if it has two\par
values, then N(E) = Pp. Pq. (neither p nor g).\par
\par
5.511 How can logic--all-embracing logic, which mirrors the world--use\par
such peculiar crotchets and contrivances? Only because they are all\par
connected with one another in an infinitely fine network, the great\par
mirror.\par
\par
5.512 &apos;Pp&apos; is true if &apos;p&apos; is false. Therefore, in the proposition &apos;Pp&apos;,\par
when it is true, &apos;p&apos; is a false proposition. How then can the stroke &apos;P&apos;\par
make it agree with reality? But in &apos;Pp&apos; it is not &apos;P&apos; that negates, it\par
is rather what is common to all the signs of this notation that negate\par
p. That is to say the common rule that governs the construction of &apos;Pp&apos;,\par
&apos;PPPp&apos;, &apos;Pp C Pp&apos;, &apos;Pp. Pp&apos;, etc. etc. (ad inf.). And this common factor\par
mirrors negation.\par
\par
5.513 We might say that what is common to all symbols that affirm both p\par
and q is the proposition &apos;p. q&apos;; and that what is common to all symbols\par
that affirm either p or q is the proposition &apos;p C q&apos;. And similarly we\par
can say that two propositions are opposed to one another if they have\par
nothing in common with one another, and that every proposition has only\par
one negative, since there is only one proposition that lies completely\par
outside it. Thus in Russell&apos;s notation too it is manifest that &apos;q: p C\par
Pp&apos; says the same thing as &apos;q&apos;, that &apos;p C Pq&apos; says nothing.\par
\par
5.514 Once a notation has been established, there will be in it a rule\par
governing the construction of all propositions that negate p, a rule\par
governing the construction of all propositions that affirm p, and a rule\par
governing the construction of all propositions that affirm p or q; and\par
so on. These rules are equivalent to the symbols; and in them their\par
sense is mirrored.\par
\par
5.515 It must be manifest in our symbols that it can only be\par
propositions that are combined with one another by &apos;C&apos;, &apos;.&apos;, etc.\par
And this is indeed the case, since the symbol in &apos;p&apos; and &apos;q&apos; itself\par
presupposes &apos;C&apos;, &apos;P&apos;, etc. If the sign &apos;p&apos; in &apos;p C q&apos; does not stand for\par
a complex sign, then it cannot have sense by itself: but in that case\par
the signs &apos;p C p&apos;, &apos;p. p&apos;, etc., which have the same sense as p, must\par
also lack sense. But if &apos;p C p&apos; has no sense, then &apos;p C q&apos; cannot have a\par
sense either.\par
\par
5.5151 Must the sign of a negative proposition be constructed with that\par
of the positive proposition? Why should it not be possible to express a\par
negative proposition by means of a negative fact? (E.g. suppose that &quot;a&apos;\par
does not stand in a certain relation to &apos;b&apos;; then this might be used\par
to say that aRb was not the case.) But really even in this case the\par
negative proposition is constructed by an indirect use of the positive.\par
The positive proposition necessarily presupposes the existence of the\par
negative proposition and vice versa.\par
\par
5.52 If E has as its values all the values of a function fx for all\par
values of x, then N(E) = P(dx). fx.\par
\par
5.521 I dissociate the concept all from truth-functions. Frege and\par
Russell introduced generality in association with logical productor\par
logical sum. This made it difficult to understand the propositions\par
&apos;(dx). fx&apos; and &apos;(x) . fx&apos;, in which both ideas are embedded.\par
\par
5.522 What is peculiar to the generality-sign is first, that it\par
indicates a logical prototype, and secondly, that it gives prominence to\par
constants.\par
\par
5.523 The generality-sign occurs as an argument.\par
\par
5.524 If objects are given, then at the same time we are given all\par
objects. If elementary propositions are given, then at the same time all\par
elementary propositions are given.\par
\par
5.525 It is incorrect to render the proposition &apos;(dx). fx&apos; in the\par
words, &apos;fx is possible&apos; as Russell does. The certainty, possibility, or\par
impossibility of a situation is not expressed by a proposition, but\par
by an expression&apos;s being a tautology, a proposition with a sense, or\par
a contradiction. The precedent to which we are constantly inclined to\par
appeal must reside in the symbol itself.\par
\par
5.526 We can describe the world completely by means of fully generalized\par
propositions, i.e. without first correlating any name with a particular\par
object.\par
\par
5.5261 A fully generalized proposition, like every other proposition, is\par
composite. (This is shown by the fact that in &apos;(dx, O). Ox&apos; we have\par
to mention &apos;O&apos; and &apos;s&apos; separately. They both, independently, stand in\par
signifying relations to the world, just as is the case in ungeneralized\par
propositions.) It is a mark of a composite symbol that it has something\par
in common with other symbols.\par
\par
5.5262 The truth or falsity of every proposition does make some\par
alteration in the general construction of the world. And the range that\par
the totality of elementary propositions leaves open for its construction\par
is exactly the same as that which is delimited by entirely general\par
propositions. (If an elementary proposition is true, that means, at any\par
rate, one more true elementary proposition.)\par
\par
5.53 Identity of object I express by identity of sign, and not by using\par
a sign for identity. Difference of objects I express by difference of\par
signs.\par
\par
5.5301 It is self-evident that identity is not a relation between\par
objects. This becomes very clear if one considers, for example, the\par
proposition &apos;(x) : fx. z. x = a&apos;. What this proposition says is simply\par
that only a satisfies the function f, and not that only things that have\par
a certain relation to a satisfy the function, Of course, it might then\par
be said that only a did have this relation to a; but in order to express\par
that, we should need the identity-sign itself.\par
\par
5.5302 Russell&apos;s definition of &apos;=&apos; is inadequate, because according to\par
it we cannot say that two objects have all their properties in common.\par
(Even if this proposition is never correct, it still has sense.)\par
\par
5.5303 Roughly speaking, to say of two things that they are identical is\par
nonsense, and to say of one thing that it is identical with itself is to\par
say nothing at all.\par
\par
5.531 Thus I do not write &apos;f(a, b). a = b&apos;, but &apos;f(a, a)&apos; (or &apos;f(b, b));\par
and not &apos;f(a,b). Pa = b&apos;, but &apos;f(a, b)&apos;.\par
\par
5.532 And analogously I do not write &apos;(dx, y). f(x, y). x = y&apos;, but\par
&apos;(dx) . f(x, x)&apos;; and not &apos;(dx, y). f(x, y). Px = y&apos;, but &apos;(dx, y). f(x,\par
y)&apos;. 5.5321 Thus, for example, instead of &apos;(x): fx z x = a&apos; we write\par
&apos;(dx). fx . z: (dx, y). fx. fy&apos;. And the proposition, &apos;Only one x\par
satisfies f( )&apos;, will read &apos;(dx). fx: P(dx, y). fx. fy&apos;.\par
\par
5.533 The identity-sign, therefore, is not an essential constituent of\par
conceptual notation.\par
\par
5.534 And now we see that in a correct conceptual notation\par
pseudo-propositions like &apos;a = a&apos;, &apos;a = b. b = c. z a = c&apos;, &apos;(x). x = x&apos;,\par
&apos;(dx). x = a&apos;, etc. cannot even be written down.\par
\par
5.535 This also disposes of all the problems that were connected with\par
such pseudo-propositions. All the problems that Russell&apos;s &apos;axiom of\par
infinity&apos; brings with it can be solved at this point. What the axiom of\par
infinity is intended to say would express itself in language through the\par
existence of infinitely many names with different meanings.\par
\par
5.5351 There are certain cases in which one is tempted to use\par
expressions of the form &apos;a = a&apos; or &apos;p z p&apos; and the like. In fact, this\par
happens when one wants to talk about prototypes, e.g. about proposition,\par
thing, etc. Thus in Russell&apos;s Principles of Mathematics &apos;p is a\par
proposition&apos;--which is nonsense--was given the symbolic rendering &apos;p z\par
p&apos; and placed as an hypothesis in front of certain propositions in order\par
to exclude from their argument-places everything but propositions. (It\par
is nonsense to place the hypothesis &apos;p z p&apos; in front of a proposition,\par
in order to ensure that its arguments shall have the right form, if only\par
because with a non-proposition as argument the hypothesis becomes not\par
false but nonsensical, and because arguments of the wrong kind make the\par
proposition itself nonsensical, so that it preserves itself from wrong\par
arguments just as well, or as badly, as the hypothesis without sense\par
that was appended for that purpose.)\par
\par
5.5352 In the same way people have wanted to express, &apos;There are\par
no things &apos;, by writing &apos;P(dx). x = x&apos;. But even if this were a\par
proposition, would it not be equally true if in fact &apos;there were things&apos;\par
but they were not identical with themselves?\par
\par
5.54 In the general propositional form propositions occur in other\par
propositions only as bases of truth-operations.\par
\par
5.541 At first sight it looks as if it were also possible for one\par
proposition to occur in another in a different way. Particularly with\par
certain forms of proposition in psychology, such as &apos;A believes that p\par
is the case&apos; and A has the thought p&apos;, etc. For if these are considered\par
superficially, it looks as if the proposition p stood in some kind of\par
relation to an object A. (And in modern theory of knowledge (Russell,\par
Moore, etc.) these propositions have actually been construed in this\par
way.)\par
\par
5.542 It is clear, however, that &apos;A believes that p&apos;, &apos;A has the thought\par
p&apos;, and &apos;A says p&apos; are of the form &apos;&quot;p&quot; says p&apos;: and this does\par
not involve a correlation of a fact with an object, but rather the\par
correlation of facts by means of the correlation of their objects.\par
\par
5.5421 This shows too that there is no such thing as the soul--the\par
subject, etc.--as it is conceived in the superficial psychology of the\par
present day. Indeed a composite soul would no longer be a soul.\par
\par
5.5422 The correct explanation of the form of the proposition, &apos;A makes\par
the judgement p&apos;, must show that it is impossible for a judgement to\par
be a piece of nonsense. (Russell&apos;s theory does not satisfy this\par
requirement.)\par
\par
5.5423 To perceive a complex means to perceive that its constituents\par
are related to one another in such and such a way. This no doubt also\par
explains why there are two possible ways of seeing the figure as a cube;\par
and all similar phenomena. For we really see two different facts. (If I\par
look in the first place at the corners marked a and only glance at the\par
b&apos;s, then the a&apos;s appear to be in front, and vice versa).\par
\par
5.55 We now have to answer a priori the question about all the possible\par
forms of elementary propositions. Elementary propositions consist of\par
names. Since, however, we are unable to give the number of names with\par
different meanings, we are also unable to give the composition of\par
elementary propositions.\par
\par
5.551 Our fundamental principle is that whenever a question can be\par
decided by logic at all it must be possible to decide it without more\par
ado. (And if we get into a position where we have to look at the world\par
for an answer to such a problem, that shows that we are on a completely\par
wrong track.)\par
\par
5.552 The &apos;experience&apos; that we need in order to understand logic is not\par
that something or other is the state of things, but that something\par
is: that, however, is not an experience. Logic is prior to every\par
experience--that something is so. It is prior to the question &apos;How?&apos; not\par
prior to the question &apos;What?&apos;\par
\par
5.5521 And if this were not so, how could we apply logic? We might put\par
it in this way: if there would be a logic even if there were no world,\par
how then could there be a logic given that there is a world?\par
\par
5.553 Russell said that there were simple relations between different\par
numbers of things (individuals). But between what numbers? And how is\par
this supposed to be decided?--By experience? (There is no pre-eminent\par
number.)\par
\par
5.554 It would be completely arbitrary to give any specific form.\par
\par
5.5541 It is supposed to be possible to answer a priori the question\par
whether I can get into a position in which I need the sign for a\par
27-termed relation in order to signify something.\par
\par
5.5542 But is it really legitimate even to ask such a question? Can we\par
set up a form of sign without knowing whether anything can correspond to\par
it? Does it make sense to ask what there must be in order that something\par
can be the case?\par
\par
5.555 Clearly we have some concept of elementary propositions quite\par
apart from their particular logical forms. But when there is a system by\par
which we can create symbols, the system is what is important for logic\par
and not the individual symbols. And anyway, is it really possible that\par
in logic I should have to deal with forms that I can invent? What I have\par
to deal with must be that which makes it possible for me to invent them.\par
\par
5.556 There cannot be a hierarchy of the forms of elementary\par
propositions. We can foresee only what we ourselves construct.\par
\par
5.5561 Empirical reality is limited by the totality of objects.\par
The limit also makes itself manifest in the totality of elementary\par
propositions. Hierarchies are and must be independent of reality.\par
\par
5.5562 If we know on purely logical grounds that there must be\par
elementary propositions, then everyone who understands propositions in\par
their C form must know It.\par
\par
5.5563 In fact, all the propositions of our everyday language, just as\par
they stand, are in perfect logical order.--That utterly simple thing,\par
which we have to formulate here, is not a likeness of the truth, but\par
the truth itself in its entirety. (Our problems are not abstract, but\par
perhaps the most concrete that there are.)\par
\par
5.557 The application of logic decides what elementary propositions\par
there are. What belongs to its application, logic cannot anticipate. It\par
is clear that logic must not clash with its application. But logic\par
has to be in contact with its application. Therefore logic and its\par
application must not overlap.\par
\par
5.5571 If I cannot say a priori what elementary propositions there are,\par
then the attempt to do so must lead to obvious nonsense. 5.6 The limits\par
of my language mean the limits of my world.\par
\par
5.61 Logic pervades the world: the limits of the world are also its\par
limits. So we cannot say in logic, &apos;The world has this in it, and\par
this, but not that.&apos; For that would appear to presuppose that we were\par
excluding certain possibilities, and this cannot be the case, since it\par
would require that logic should go beyond the limits of the world; for\par
only in that way could it view those limits from the other side as well.\par
We cannot think what we cannot think; so what we cannot think we cannot\par
say either.\par
\par
5.62 This remark provides the key to the problem, how much truth there\par
is in solipsism. For what the solipsist means is quite correct; only it\par
cannot be said, but makes itself manifest. The world is my world: this\par
is manifest in the fact that the limits of language (of that language\par
which alone I understand) mean the limits of my world.\par
\par
5.621 The world and life are one.\par
\par
5.63 I am my world. (The microcosm.)\par
\par
5.631 There is no such thing as the subject that thinks or entertains\par
ideas. If I wrote a book called The World as l found it, I should have\par
to include a report on my body, and should have to say which parts were\par
subordinate to my will, and which were not, etc., this being a method of\par
isolating the subject, or rather of showing that in an important sense\par
there is no subject; for it alone could not be mentioned in that book.--\par
\par
5.632 The subject does not belong to the world: rather, it is a limit of\par
the world.\par
\par
5.633 Where in the world is a metaphysical subject to be found? You will\par
say that this is exactly like the case of the eye and the visual field.\par
But really you do not see the eye. And nothing in the visual field\par
allows you to infer that it is seen by an eye.\par
\par
5.6331 For the form of the visual field is surely not like this\par
\par
5.634 This is connected with the fact that no part of our experience is\par
at the same time a priori. Whatever we see could be other than it is.\par
Whatever we can describe at all could be other than it is. There is no a\par
priori order of things.\par
\par
5.64 Here it can be seen that solipsism, when its implications are\par
followed out strictly, coincides with pure realism. The self of\par
solipsism shrinks to a point without extension, and there remains the\par
reality co-ordinated with it.\par
\par
5.641 Thus there really is a sense in which philosophy can talk\par
about the self in a non-psychological way. What brings the self into\par
philosophy is the fact that &apos;the world is my world&apos;. The philosophical\par
self is not the human being, not the human body, or the human soul, with\par
which psychology deals, but rather the metaphysical subject, the limit\par
of the world--not a part of it.\par
\par
6. The general form of a truth-function is [p, E, N(E)].\par
\par
This is the general form of a proposition.\par
\par
6.001 What this says is just that every proposition is a result of\par
successive applications to elementary propositions of the operation N(E)\par
\par
6.002 If we are given the general form according to which propositions\par
are constructed, then with it we are also given the general form\par
according to which one proposition can be generated out of another by\par
means of an operation.\par
\par
6.01 Therefore the general form of an operation /&apos;(n) is [E, N(E)]&apos; (n)\par
( = [n, E, N(E)]). This is the most general form of transition from one\par
proposition to another.\par
\par
6.02 And this is how we arrive at numbers. I give the following\par
definitions x = /0x Def., /&apos;/v&apos;x = /v+1&apos;x Def. So, in accordance with\par
these rules, which deal with signs, we write the series x, /&apos;x,\par
/&apos;/&apos;x, /&apos;/&apos;/&apos;x,..., in the following way /0&apos;x, /0+1&apos;x, /0+1+1&apos;x,\par
/0+1+1+1&apos;x,.... Therefore, instead of &apos;[x, E, /&apos;E]&apos;, I write &apos;[/0&apos;x,\par
/v&apos;x, /v+1&apos;x]&apos;. And I give the following definitions 0 + 1 = 1 Def., 0 +\par
1 + 1 = 2 Def., 0 + 1 + 1 +1 = 3 Def., (and so on).\par
\par
6.021 A number is the exponent of an operation.\par
\par
6.022 The concept of number is simply what is common to all numbers, the\par
general form of a number. The concept of number is the variable number.\par
And the concept of numerical equality is the general form of all\par
particular cases of numerical equality.\par
\par
6.03 The general form of an integer is [0, E, E +1].\par
\par
6.031 The theory of classes is completely superfluous in mathematics.\par
This is connected with the fact that the generality required in\par
mathematics is not accidental generality.\par
\par
6.1 The propositions of logic are tautologies.\par
\par
6.11 Therefore the propositions of logic say nothing. (They are the\par
analytic propositions.)\par
\par
6.111 All theories that make a proposition of logic appear to have\par
content are false. One might think, for example, that the words &apos;true&apos;\par
and &apos;false&apos; signified two properties among other properties, and then it\par
would seem to be a remarkable fact that every proposition possessed one\par
of these properties. On this theory it seems to be anything but obvious,\par
just as, for instance, the proposition, &apos;All roses are either yellow or\par
red&apos;, would not sound obvious even if it were true. Indeed, the logical\par
proposition acquires all the characteristics of a proposition of natural\par
science and this is the sure sign that it has been construed wrongly.\par
\par
6.112 The correct explanation of the propositions of logic must assign\par
to them a unique status among all propositions.\par
\par
6.113 It is the peculiar mark of logical propositions that one can\par
recognize that they are true from the symbol alone, and this fact\par
contains in itself the whole philosophy of logic. And so too it is\par
a very important fact that the truth or falsity of non-logical\par
propositions cannot be recognized from the propositions alone.\par
\par
6.12 The fact that the propositions of logic are tautologies shows the\par
formal--logical--properties of language and the world. The fact that\par
a tautology is yielded by this particular way of connecting its\par
constituents characterizes the logic of its constituents. If\par
propositions are to yield a tautology when they are connected in a\par
certain way, they must have certain structural properties. So their\par
yielding a tautology when combined in this shows that they possess these\par
structural properties.\par
\par
6.1201 For example, the fact that the propositions &apos;p&apos; and &apos;Pp&apos; in the\par
combination &apos;(p. Pp)&apos; yield a tautology shows that they contradict one\par
another. The fact that the propositions &apos;p z q&apos;, &apos;p&apos;, and &apos;q&apos;, combined\par
with one another in the form &apos;(p z q). (p):z: (q)&apos;, yield a tautology\par
shows that q follows from p and p z q. The fact that &apos;(x). fxx:z: fa&apos; is\par
a tautology shows that fa follows from (x). fx. Etc. etc.\par
\par
6.1202 It is clear that one could achieve the same purpose by using\par
contradictions instead of tautologies.\par
\par
6.1203 In order to recognize an expression as a tautology, in cases\par
where no generality-sign occurs in it, one can employ the following\par
intuitive method: instead of &apos;p&apos;, &apos;q&apos;, &apos;r&apos;, etc. I write &apos;TpF&apos;, &apos;TqF&apos;,\par
&apos;TrF&apos;, etc. Truth-combinations I express by means of brackets, e.g. and\par
I use lines to express the correlation of the truth or falsity of the\par
whole proposition with the truth-combinations of its truth-arguments,\par
in the following way So this sign, for instance, would represent\par
the proposition p z q. Now, by way of example, I wish to examine the\par
proposition P(p.Pp) (the law of contradiction) in order to determine\par
whether it is a tautology. In our notation the form &apos;PE&apos; is written as\par
and the form &apos;E. n&apos; as Hence the proposition P(p. Pp). reads as follows\par
If we here substitute &apos;p&apos; for &apos;q&apos; and examine how the outermost T and F\par
are connected with the innermost ones, the result will be that the truth\par
of the whole proposition is correlated with all the truth-combinations\par
of its argument, and its falsity with none of the truth-combinations.\par
\par
6.121 The propositions of logic demonstrate the logical properties\par
of propositions by combining them so as to form propositions that say\par
nothing. This method could also be called a zero-method. In a logical\par
proposition, propositions are brought into equilibrium with one\par
another, and the state of equilibrium then indicates what the logical\par
constitution of these propositions must be.\par
\par
6.122 It follows from this that we can actually do without logical\par
propositions; for in a suitable notation we can in fact recognize the\par
formal properties of propositions by mere inspection of the propositions\par
themselves.\par
\par
6.1221 If, for example, two propositions &apos;p&apos; and &apos;q&apos; in the combination\par
&apos;p z q&apos; yield a tautology, then it is clear that q follows from p. For\par
example, we see from the two propositions themselves that &apos;q&apos; follows\par
from &apos;p z q. p&apos;, but it is also possible to show it in this way: we\par
combine them to form &apos;p z q. p:z: q&apos;, and then show that this is a\par
tautology.\par
\par
6.1222 This throws some light on the question why logical propositions\par
cannot be confirmed by experience any more than they can be refuted by\par
it. Not only must a proposition of logic be irrefutable by any\par
possible experience, but it must also be unconfirmable by any possible\par
experience.\par
\par
6.1223 Now it becomes clear why people have often felt as if it were\par
for us to &apos;postulate&apos; the &apos;truths of logic&apos;. The reason is that we can\par
postulate them in so far as we can postulate an adequate notation.\par
\par
6.1224 It also becomes clear now why logic was called the theory of\par
forms and of inference.\par
\par
6.123 Clearly the laws of logic cannot in their turn be subject to\par
laws of logic. (There is not, as Russell thought, a special law of\par
contradiction for each &apos;type&apos;; one law is enough, since it is not\par
applied to itself.)\par
\par
6.1231 The mark of a logical proposition is not general validity. To be\par
general means no more than to be accidentally valid for all things.\par
An ungeneralized proposition can be tautological just as well as a\par
generalized one.\par
\par
6.1232 The general validity of logic might be called essential, in\par
contrast with the accidental general validity of such propositions\par
as &apos;All men are mortal&apos;. Propositions like Russell&apos;s &apos;axiom of\par
reducibility&apos; are not logical propositions, and this explains our\par
feeling that, even if they were true, their truth could only be the\par
result of a fortunate accident.\par
\par
6.1233 It is possible to imagine a world in which the axiom of\par
reducibility is not valid. It is clear, however, that logic has nothing\par
to do with the question whether our world really is like that or not.\par
\par
6.124 The propositions of logic describe the scaffolding of the world,\par
or rather they represent it. They have no &apos;subject-matter&apos;. They\par
presuppose that names have meaning and elementary propositions sense;\par
and that is their connexion with the world. It is clear that something\par
about the world must be indicated by the fact that certain combinations\par
of symbols--whose essence involves the possession of a determinate\par
character--are tautologies. This contains the decisive point. We have\par
said that some things are arbitrary in the symbols that we use and that\par
some things are not. In logic it is only the latter that express: but\par
that means that logic is not a field in which we express what we wish\par
with the help of signs, but rather one in which the nature of the\par
absolutely necessary signs speaks for itself. If we know the logical\par
syntax of any sign-language, then we have already been given all the\par
propositions of logic.\par
\par
6.125 It is possible--indeed possible even according to the old\par
conception of logic--to give in advance a description of all &apos;true&apos;\par
logical propositions.\par
\par
6.1251 Hence there can never be surprises in logic.\par
\par
6.126 One can calculate whether a proposition belongs to logic, by\par
calculating the logical properties of the symbol. And this is what we\par
do when we &apos;prove&apos; a logical proposition. For, without bothering about\par
sense or meaning, we construct the logical proposition out of others\par
using only rules that deal with signs. The proof of logical propositions\par
consists in the following process: we produce them out of other logical\par
propositions by successively applying certain operations that always\par
generate further tautologies out of the initial ones. (And in fact only\par
tautologies follow from a tautology.) Of course this way of showing that\par
the propositions of logic are tautologies is not at all essential to\par
logic, if only because the propositions from which the proof starts must\par
show without any proof that they are tautologies.\par
\par
6.1261 In logic process and result are equivalent. (Hence the absence of\par
surprise.)\par
\par
6.1262 Proof in logic is merely a mechanical expedient to facilitate the\par
recognition of tautologies in complicated cases.\par
\par
6.1263 Indeed, it would be altogether too remarkable if a proposition\par
that had sense could be proved logically from others, and so too could a\par
logical proposition. It is clear from the start that a logical proof of\par
a proposition that has sense and a proof in logic must be two entirely\par
different things.\par
\par
6.1264 A proposition that has sense states something, which is shown by\par
its proof to be so. In logic every proposition is the form of a proof.\par
Every proposition of logic is a modus ponens represented in signs. (And\par
one cannot express the modus ponens by means of a proposition.)\par
\par
6.1265 It is always possible to construe logic in such a way that every\par
proposition is its own proof.\par
\par
6.127 All the propositions of logic are of equal status: it is not\par
the case that some of them are essentially derived propositions. Every\par
tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.\par
\par
6.1271 It is clear that the number of the &apos;primitive propositions\par
of logic&apos; is arbitrary, since one could derive logic from a single\par
primitive proposition, e.g. by simply constructing the logical product\par
of Frege&apos;s primitive propositions. (Frege would perhaps say that\par
we should then no longer have an immediately self-evident primitive\par
proposition. But it is remarkable that a thinker as rigorous as Frege\par
appealed to the degree of self-evidence as the criterion of a logical\par
proposition.)\par
\par
6.13 Logic is not a body of doctrine, but a mirror-image of the world.\par
Logic is transcendental.\par
\par
6.2 Mathematics is a logical method. The propositions of mathematics are\par
equations, and therefore pseudo-propositions.\par
\par
6.21 A proposition of mathematics does not express a thought.\par
\par
6.211 Indeed in real life a mathematical proposition is never what\par
we want. Rather, we make use of mathematical propositions only in\par
inferences from propositions that do not belong to mathematics to others\par
that likewise do not belong to mathematics. (In philosophy the question,\par
&apos;What do we actually use this word or this proposition for?&apos; repeatedly\par
leads to valuable insights.)\par
\par
6.22 The logic of the world, which is shown in tautologies by the\par
propositions of logic, is shown in equations by mathematics.\par
\par
6.23 If two expressions are combined by means of the sign of equality,\par
that means that they can be substituted for one another. But it must be\par
manifest in the two expressions themselves whether this is the case\par
or not. When two expressions can be substituted for one another, that\par
characterizes their logical form.\par
\par
6.231 It is a property of affirmation that it can be construed as double\par
negation. It is a property of &apos;1 + 1 + 1 + 1&apos; that it can be construed\par
as &apos;(1 + 1) + (1 + 1)&apos;.\par
\par
6.232 Frege says that the two expressions have the same meaning but\par
different senses. But the essential point about an equation is that it\par
is not necessary in order to show that the two expressions connected by\par
the sign of equality have the same meaning, since this can be seen from\par
the two expressions themselves.\par
\par
6.2321 And the possibility of proving the propositions of mathematics\par
means simply that their correctness can be perceived without its being\par
necessary that what they express should itself be compared with the\par
facts in order to determine its correctness.\par
\par
6.2322 It is impossible to assert the identity of meaning of two\par
expressions. For in order to be able to assert anything about their\par
meaning, I must know their meaning, and I cannot know their meaning\par
without knowing whether what they mean is the same or different.\par
\par
6.2323 An equation merely marks the point of view from which I consider\par
the two expressions: it marks their equivalence in meaning.\par
\par
6.233 The question whether intuition is needed for the solution of\par
mathematical problems must be given the answer that in this case\par
language itself provides the necessary intuition.\par
\par
6.2331 The process of calculating serves to bring about that intuition.\par
Calculation is not an experiment.\par
\par
6.234 Mathematics is a method of logic.\par
\par
6.2341 It is the essential characteristic of mathematical method that\par
it employs equations. For it is because of this method that every\par
proposition of mathematics must go without saying.\par
\par
6.24 The method by which mathematics arrives at its equations is the\par
method of substitution. For equations express the substitutability of\par
two expressions and, starting from a number of equations, we advance to\par
new equations by substituting different expressions in accordance with\par
the equations.\par
\par
6.241 Thus the proof of the proposition 2 t 2 = 4 runs as follows:\par
(/v)n&apos;x = /v x u&apos;x Def., /2 x 2&apos;x = (/2)2&apos;x = (/2)1 + 1&apos;x = /2&apos; /2&apos;x =\par
/1 + 1&apos;/1 + 1&apos;x = (/&apos;/)&apos;(/&apos;/)&apos;x =/&apos;/&apos;/&apos;/&apos;x = /1 + 1 + 1 + 1&apos;x = /4&apos;x.\par
\par
6.3 The exploration of logic means the exploration of everything that is\par
subject to law. And outside logic everything is accidental.\par
\par
6.31 The so-called law of induction cannot possibly be a law of logic,\par
since it is obviously a proposition with sense.---Nor, therefore, can it\par
be an a priori law.\par
\par
6.32 The law of causality is not a law but the form of a law.\par
\par
6.321 &apos;Law of causality&apos;--that is a general name. And just as in\par
mechanics, for example, there are &apos;minimum-principles&apos;, such as the law\par
of least action, so too in physics there are causal laws, laws of the\par
causal form.\par
\par
6.3211 Indeed people even surmised that there must be a &apos;law of least\par
action&apos; before they knew exactly how it went. (Here, as always, what is\par
certain a priori proves to be something purely logical.)\par
\par
6.33 We do not have an a priori belief in a law of conservation, but\par
rather a priori knowledge of the possibility of a logical form.\par
\par
6.34 All such propositions, including the principle of sufficient\par
reason, tile laws of continuity in nature and of least effort in nature,\par
etc. etc.--all these are a priori insights about the forms in which the\par
propositions of science can be cast.\par
\par
6.341 Newtonian mechanics, for example, imposes a unified form on the\par
description of the world. Let us imagine a white surface with irregular\par
black spots on it. We then say that whatever kind of picture these make,\par
I can always approximate as closely as I wish to the description of it\par
by covering the surface with a sufficiently fine square mesh, and then\par
saying of every square whether it is black or white. In this way I shall\par
have imposed a unified form on the description of the surface. The form\par
is optional, since I could have achieved the same result by using a net\par
with a triangular or hexagonal mesh. Possibly the use of a triangular\par
mesh would have made the description simpler: that is to say, it might\par
be that we could describe the surface more accurately with a coarse\par
triangular mesh than with a fine square mesh (or conversely), and so on.\par
The different nets correspond to different systems for describing the\par
world. Mechanics determines one form of description of the world by\par
saying that all propositions used in the description of the world must\par
be obtained in a given way from a given set of propositions--the axioms\par
of mechanics. It thus supplies the bricks for building the edifice of\par
science, and it says, &apos;Any building that you want to erect, whatever it\par
may be, must somehow be constructed with these bricks, and with these\par
alone.&apos; (Just as with the number-system we must be able to write down\par
any number we wish, so with the system of mechanics we must be able to\par
write down any proposition of physics that we wish.)\par
\par
6.342 And now we can see the relative position of logic and mechanics.\par
(The net might also consist of more than one kind of mesh: e.g. we\par
could use both triangles and hexagons.) The possibility of describing a\par
picture like the one mentioned above with a net of a given form tells us\par
nothing about the picture. (For that is true of all such pictures.)\par
But what does characterize the picture is that it can be described\par
completely by a particular net with a particular size of mesh. Similarly\par
the possibility of describing the world by means of Newtonian mechanics\par
tells us nothing about the world: but what does tell us something about\par
it is the precise way in which it is possible to describe it by these\par
means. We are also told something about the world by the fact that it\par
can be described more simply with one system of mechanics than with\par
another.\par
\par
6.343 Mechanics is an attempt to construct according to a single plan\par
all the true propositions that we need for the description of the world.\par
\par
6.3431 The laws of physics, with all their logical apparatus, still\par
speak, however indirectly, about the objects of the world.\par
\par
6.3432 We ought not to forget that any description of the world by means\par
of mechanics will be of the completely general kind. For example, it\par
will never mention particular point-masses: it will only talk about any\par
point-masses whatsoever.\par
\par
6.35 Although the spots in our picture are geometrical figures,\par
nevertheless geometry can obviously say nothing at all about their\par
actual form and position. The network, however, is purely geometrical;\par
all its properties can be given a priori. Laws like the principle of\par
sufficient reason, etc. are about the net and not about what the net\par
describes.\par
\par
6.36 If there were a law of causality, it might be put in the following\par
way: There are laws of nature. But of course that cannot be said: it\par
makes itself manifest.\par
\par
6.361 One might say, using Hertt:&apos;s terminology, that only connexions\par
that are subject to law are thinkable.\par
\par
6.3611 We cannot compare a process with &apos;the passage of time&apos;--there is\par
no such thing--but only with another process (such as the working of a\par
chronometer). Hence we can describe the lapse of time only by relying on\par
some other process. Something exactly analogous applies to space: e.g.\par
when people say that neither of two events (which exclude one another)\par
can occur, because there is nothing to cause the one to occur rather\par
than the other, it is really a matter of our being unable to describe\par
one of the two events unless there is some sort of asymmetry to be\par
found. And if such an asymmetry is to be found, we can regard it as the\par
cause of the occurrence of the one and the non-occurrence of the other.\par
\par
6.36111 Kant&apos;s problem about the right hand and the left hand, which\par
cannot be made to coincide, exists even in two dimensions. Indeed, it\par
exists in one-dimensional space in which the two congruent figures,\par
a and b, cannot be made to coincide unless they are moved out of\par
this space. The right hand and the left hand are in fact completely\par
congruent. It is quite irrelevant that they cannot be made to coincide.\par
A right-hand glove could be put on the left hand, if it could be turned\par
round in four-dimensional space.\par
\par
6.362 What can be described can happen too: and what the law of\par
causality is meant to exclude cannot even be described.\par
\par
6.363 The procedure of induction consists in accepting as true the\par
simplest law that can be reconciled with our experiences.\par
\par
6.3631 This procedure, however, has no logical justification but only a\par
psychological one. It is clear that there are no grounds for believing\par
that the simplest eventuality will in fact be realized.\par
\par
6.36311 It is an hypothesis that the sun will rise tomorrow: and this\par
means that we do not know whether it will rise.\par
\par
6.37 There is no compulsion making one thing happen because another has\par
happened. The only necessity that exists is logical necessity.\par
\par
6.371 The whole modern conception of the world is founded on the\par
illusion that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of\par
natural phenomena.\par
\par
6.372 Thus people today stop at the laws of nature, treating them as\par
something inviolable, just as God and Fate were treated in past ages.\par
And in fact both are right and both wrong: though the view of the\par
ancients is clearer in so far as they have a clear and acknowledged\par
terminus, while the modern system tries to make it look as if everything\par
were explained.\par
\par
\par
6.373 The world is independent of my will.\par
\par
\par
6.374 Even if all that we wish for were to happen, still this would\par
only be a favour granted by fate, so to speak: for there is no logical\par
connexion between the will and the world, which would guarantee it, and\par
the supposed physical connexion itself is surely not something that we\par
could will.\par
\par
\par
6.375 Just as the only necessity that exists is logical necessity, so\par
too the only impossibility that exists is logical impossibility.\par
\par
6.3751 For example, the simultaneous presence of two colours at the same\par
place in the visual field is impossible, in fact logically impossible,\par
since it is ruled out by the logical structure of colour. Let us think\par
how this contradiction appears in physics: more or less as follows--a\par
particle cannot have two velocities at the same time; that is to say, it\par
cannot be in two places at the same time; that is to say, particles that\par
are in different places at the same time cannot be identical. (It\par
is clear that the logical product of two elementary propositions can\par
neither be a tautology nor a contradiction. The statement that a point\par
in the visual field has two different colours at the same time is a\par
contradiction.)\par
\par
6.4 All propositions are of equal value.\par
\par
6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world\par
everything is as it is, and everything happens as it does happen: in it\par
no value exists--and if it did exist, it would have no value. If there\par
is any value that does have value, it must lie outside the whole sphere\par
of what happens and is the case. For all that happens and is the case\par
is accidental. What makes it non-accidental cannot lie within the world,\par
since if it did it would itself be accidental. It must lie outside the\par
world.\par
\par
6.42 So too it is impossible for there to be propositions of ethics.\par
Propositions can express nothing that is higher.\par
\par
6.421 It is clear that ethics cannot be put into words. Ethics is\par
transcendental. (Ethics and aesthetics are one and the same.)\par
\par
6.422 When an ethical law of the form, &apos;Thou shalt...&apos; is laid down,\par
one&apos;s first thought is, &apos;And what if I do, not do it?&apos; It is clear,\par
however, that ethics has nothing to do with punishment and reward in the\par
usual sense of the terms. So our question about the consequences of an\par
action must be unimportant.--At least those consequences should not be\par
events. For there must be something right about the question we posed.\par
There must indeed be some kind of ethical reward and ethical punishment,\par
but they must reside in the action itself. (And it is also clear that\par
the reward must be something pleasant and the punishment something\par
unpleasant.)\par
\par
6.423 It is impossible to speak about the will in so far as it is\par
the subject of ethical attributes. And the will as a phenomenon is of\par
interest only to psychology.\par
\par
6.43 If the good or bad exercise of the will does alter the world, it\par
can alter only the limits of the world, not the facts--not what can\par
be expressed by means of language. In short the effect must be that it\par
becomes an altogether different world. It must, so to speak, wax and\par
wane as a whole. The world of the happy man is a different one from that\par
of the unhappy man.\par
\par
6.431 So too at death the world does not alter, but comes to an end.\par
\par
6.4311 Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience\par
death. If we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration\par
but timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the\par
present. Our life has no end in just the way in which our visual field\par
has no limits.\par
\par
6.4312 Not only is there no guarantee of the temporal immortality of the\par
human soul, that is to say of its eternal survival after death; but, in\par
any case, this assumption completely fails to accomplish the purpose\par
for which it has always been intended. Or is some riddle solved by my\par
surviving for ever? Is not this eternal life itself as much of a riddle\par
as our present life? The solution of the riddle of life in space and\par
time lies outside space and time. (It is certainly not the solution of\par
any problems of natural science that is required.)\par
\par
6.432 How things are in the world is a matter of complete indifference\par
for what is higher. God does not reveal himself in the world.\par
\par
6.4321 The facts all contribute only to setting the problem, not to its\par
solution.\par
\par
6.44 It is not how things are in the world that is mystical, but that it\par
exists.\par
\par
6.45 To view the world sub specie aeterni is to view it as a whole--a\par
limited whole. Feeling the world as a limited whole--it is this that is\par
mystical.\par
\par
6.5 When the answer cannot be put into words, neither can the question\par
be put into words. The riddle does not exist. If a question can be\par
framed at all, it is also possible to answer it.\par
\par
6.51 Scepticism is not irrefutable, but obviously nonsensical, when it\par
tries to raise doubts where no questions can be asked. For doubt can\par
exist only where a question exists, a question only where an answer\par
exists, and an answer only where something can be said.\par
\par
6.52 We feel that even when all possible scientific questions have been\par
answered, the problems of life remain completely untouched. Of course\par
there are then no questions left, and this itself is the answer.\par
\par
6.521 The solution of the problem of life is seen in the vanishing of\par
the problem. (Is not this the reason why those who have found after a\par
long period of doubt that the sense of life became clear to them have\par
then been unable to say what constituted that sense?)\par
\par
6.522 There are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. They make\par
themselves manifest. They are what is mystical.\par

6.53 The correct method in philosophy would really be the following:\par
to say nothing except what can be said, i.e. propositions of natural\par
science--i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy--and\par
then, whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical, to\par
demonstrate to him that he had failed to give a meaning to certain signs\par
in his propositions. Although it would not be satisfying to the\par
other person--he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him\par
philosophy--this method would be the only strictly correct one.\par
\par
6.54 My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me\par
finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through\par
them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder,\par
after he has climbed up on it.) He must transcend these propositions,\par
and then he will see the world aright.\par
\par
7. What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.\par

<text >3.24 A proposition about a complex stands in an internal relation to aproposition about a constituent of the complex. A complex can be givenonly by its description, which will be right or wrong. A propositionthat mentions a complex will not be nonsensical, if the complex doesnot exits, but simply false. When a propositional element signifies acomplex, this can be seen from an indeterminateness in the propositionsin which it occurs. In such cases we know that the proposition leavessomething undetermined. (In fact the notation for generality containsa prototype.) The contraction of a symbol for a complex into a simplesymbol can be expressed in a definition.</text>

<text >3.333 The reason why a function cannot be its own argument is that thesign for a function already contains the prototype of its argument, andit cannot contain itself. For let us suppose that the function F(fx)could be its own argument: in that case there would be a proposition&apos;F(F(fx))&apos;, in which the outer function F and the inner function F musthave different meanings, since the inner one has the form O(f(x)) andthe outer one has the form Y(O(fx)). Only the letter &apos;F&apos; is common tothe two functions, but the letter by itself signifies nothing. Thisimmediately becomes clear if instead of &apos;F(Fu)&apos; we write &apos;(do): F(Ou).Ou = Fu&apos;. That disposes of Russell&apos;s paradox.</text>

the outer one has the form Y(O(fx)). Only the letter &apos;F&apos; is common to\par
the two functions, but the letter by itself signifies nothing. This\par
immediately becomes clear if instead of &apos;F(Fu)&apos; we write &apos;(do): F(Ou).\par
Ou = Fu&apos;. That disposes of Russell&apos;s paradox.\par

<text >4.0411. If, for example, we wanted to express what we now write as &apos;(x).fx&apos; by putting an affix in front of &apos;fx&apos;--for instance by writing&apos;Gen. fx&apos;--it would not be adequate: we should not know what wasbeing generalized. If we wanted to signalize it with an affix &apos;g&apos;--forinstance by writing &apos;f(xg)&apos;--that would not be adequate either: weshould not know the scope of the generality-sign. If we were to try todo it by introducing a mark into the argument-places--for instance bywriting &apos;(G,G). F(G,G)&apos; --it would not be adequate: we should not beable to establish the identity of the variables. And so on. All thesemodes of signifying are inadequate because they lack the necessarymathematical multiplicity.</text>

fx&apos; by putting an affix in front of &apos;fx&apos;--for instance by writing\par
&apos;Gen. fx&apos;--it would not be adequate: we should not know what was\par
being generalized. If we wanted to signalize it with an affix &apos;g&apos;--for\par
instance by writing &apos;f(xg)&apos;--that would not be adequate either: we\par
should not know the scope of the generality-sign. If we were to try to\par
do it by introducing a mark into the argument-places--for instance by\par
writing &apos;(G,G). F(G,G)&apos; --it would not be adequate: we should not be\par
able to establish the identity of the variables. And so on. All these\par
modes of signifying are inadequate because they lack the necessary\par
mathematical multiplicity.\par

<text >4.063 An analogy to illustrate the concept of truth: imagine a blackspot on white paper: you can describe the shape of the spot by saying,for each point on the sheet, whether it is black or white. To the factthat a point is black there corresponds a positive fact, and to the factthat a point is white (not black), a negative fact. If I designatea point on the sheet (a truth-value according to Frege), then thiscorresponds to the supposition that is put forward for judgement, etc.etc. But in order to be able to say that a point is black or white, Imust first know when a point is called black, and when white: in orderto be able to say,&apos;&quot;p&quot; is true (or false)&apos;, I must have determined inwhat circumstances I call &apos;p&apos; true, and in so doing I determine thesense of the proposition. Now the point where the simile breaks down isthis: we can indicate a point on the paper even if we do not knowwhat black and white are, but if a proposition has no sense, nothingcorresponds to it, since it does not designate a thing (a truth-value)which might have properties called &apos;false&apos; or &apos;true&apos;. The verb of aproposition is not &apos;is true&apos; or &apos;is false&apos;, as Frege thought: rather,that which &apos;is true&apos; must already contain the verb.</text>

(I introduce this expression in order toexhibit the source of the confusion between formal concepts and conceptsproper, which pervades the whole of traditional logic.) When somethingfalls under a formal concept as one of its objects, this cannot beexpressed by means of a proposition. Instead it is shown in the verysign for this object. (A name shows that it signifies an object, a signfor a number that it signifies a number, etc.) Formal concepts cannot,in fact, be represented by means of a function, as concepts proper can.For their characteristics, formal properties, are not expressed bymeans of functions. The expression for a formal property is a feature ofcertain symbols. So the sign for the characteristics of a formal conceptis a distinctive feature of all symbols whose meanings fall under theconcept. So the expression for a formal concept is a propositionalvariable in which this distinctive feature alone is constant.</text>

<text >5.3 All propositions are results of truth-operations on elementarypropositions. A truth-operation is the way in which a truth-functionis produced out of elementary propositions. It is of the essenceof truth-operations that, just as elementary propositions yield atruth-function of themselves, so too in the same way truth-functionsyield a further truth-function. When a truth-operation is applied totruth-functions of elementary propositions, it always generates anothertruth-function of elementary propositions, another proposition. Whena truth-operation is applied to the results of truth-operationson elementary propositions, there is always a single operation onelementary propositions that has the same result. Every proposition isthe result of truth-operations on elementary propositions.</text>

This contains the decisive point. We havesaid that some things are arbitrary in the symbols that we use and thatsome things are not.
